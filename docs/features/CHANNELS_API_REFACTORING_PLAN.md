# Channels API Refactoring Plan

## üìã Overview
Refactor the large `channels_api.py` file (1660 lines) into smaller, more manageable modules following Single Responsibility Principle.

## üéØ Goals

- **Readability**: Each file focuses on one functional area
- **Testability**: Easier to test individual components
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Code Organization**: Follow existing project patterns
