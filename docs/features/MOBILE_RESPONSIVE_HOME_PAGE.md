## Mobile Optimization for Homepage (/) – Roadmap

Status: in progress
Owner: UI/Frontend
Last updated: updated after Step 1 (unify sidebar behavior)

### Initial Prompt (translated from Russian)

"Open http://192.168.88.82:8000/ and make this page optimized for mobile phones.

— Analyze the task and the project deeply and decide how best to implement it.

— Create a detailed, step-by-step roadmap in a separate document file. We have a folder docs/features for this. If there is no such folder, create it. Document in this file all discovered and tried problems, nuances and solutions as much as possible, if any. As you progress, you will use this file as a to-do checklist, updating it and documenting what has been done, how it was done, what problems arose and what solutions were made. For history do not delete items, only update their status and comment. If during implementation it becomes clear that something needs to be added – add it to this document. This helps us keep the context window, remember what has already been done and not forget what was planned. Remember that only the English language is allowed in code and comments, strings, commit messages, error messages, logging, API responses.

When you write the plan, stop and ask me if I agree to start implementing it or if something needs to be adjusted.

Also include manual testing steps (what to click in the interface)."

### Goal
Optimize the homepage (route `/` → `templates/playlists.html`) for mobile use while preserving feature parity and consistent UX across the app. Ensure responsive layout, touch-friendly controls, accessible interactions, and good performance on low-end devices.

### Principles
- SOLID, DRY, KISS, Separation of Concerns, Single Level of Abstraction, Clean Code
- UI/UX: User-Friendly, Intuitive, Consistency, Accessibility, Feedback, Simplicity, Modern, Performance, Responsive Design

### Current State Assessment (as of reading the repo)

- Routing
  - `/` renders `playlists.html` via `app.py:playlists_page()`.
  - Other pages (e.g., `tracks.html`, `history.html`, `jobs.html`) include a shared `sidebar_styles.html` with mobile behavior.

- Templates and layout
  - `templates/playlists.html` uses inline CSS for layout and its own sidebar styling instead of shared `sidebar_styles.html`.
  - `templates/sidebar.html` provides the universal navigation plus server info, and relies on `sidebar_styles.html` for responsive rules (slide-in sidebar, `.mobile-menu-btn`, etc.).
  - Player pages extend `templates/components/player_base.html`, which already has mobile viewport meta and responsive controls.

- CSS
  - Global responsive rules exist in multiple CSS files (`player-base.css`, `player-common.css`, page-specific CSS like `history.css`, `tracks.css`, `jobs.css`).
  - `playlists.html` duplicates sidebar and layout styles inline instead of reusing `sidebar_styles.html` and a page-specific stylesheet.

- Mobile behavior gaps on the homepage
  - No hamburger button to toggle the sidebar; on small screens the sidebar becomes full-width and stacked, but cannot be hidden/shown easily.
  - The playlists table has many columns; on small screens it will overflow or require pinch/zoom. No adaptive column hiding or card layout.
  - Tap targets in the header action buttons are ok, but spacing and wrapping could be improved for small widths.
  - Repeated inline styles hinder DRY and consistency across pages; changes to shared sidebar behavior won’t propagate to `playlists.html`.

- Performance considerations
  - The homepage can be heavy if many playlists are present. No lazy rendering or virtualization, but table size is manageable. We can add simple responsive optimizations without over-engineering.

### Non-Goals (for this milestone)
- Full design overhaul or component library introduction
- PWA/offline mode
- Virtualization of large tables (can be considered later if needed)

### Deliverables
1. Mobile-optimized homepage (`/`): consistent responsive sidebar, accessible mobile navigation, and responsive playlists list.
2. Refactored homepage to use shared sidebar styles and minimal inline CSS.
3. Page-specific stylesheet for the homepage (e.g., `static/css/backups.css` style of organization; we will create `home.css`).
4. Documentation updates in this roadmap with statuses and decisions.

### High-Level Plan

1) Unify sidebar behavior on the homepage
   - Replace inline sidebar CSS in `templates/playlists.html` with shared `templates/sidebar_styles.html` include.
   - Add `.mobile-menu-btn` hamburger (as done in `tracks.html`) with the same JS toggle logic (`toggleSidebar()` + outside-click close).
   - Ensure the sidebar overlays on mobile using the shared `.sidebar.open` slide-in pattern.

2) Extract homepage styles into a dedicated CSS
   - Create `static/css/home.css` and move page-specific styles out of the template.
   - Keep only minimal structural HTML in `playlists.html`.
   - Ensure color variables and tokens align with the existing design system.

3) Responsive playlists table
   - Implement progressive disclosure:
     - At ≤ 1024px: hide low-priority columns (e.g., Forgotten, Last Sync) with CSS utility classes.
     - At ≤ 768px: switch to a stacked “card list” view using CSS display/grid (each row becomes a card with key info: Playlist name/link, Tracks, Likes, Action; the rest collapses under a details expander).
   - Maintain sorting on desktop; on mobile keep sorting for essential columns or provide a simplified toggle.

4) Header actions and controls
   - Ensure buttons wrap cleanly; increase spacing for tap targets (min 44x44 CSS pixels where feasible).
   - Keep existing functionality (Add Playlist, Rescan, Backup, QR Remote, Restart, Stop) and ensure they’re reachable without horizontal scroll.

5) Accessibility and usability
   - Confirm viewport meta is present (it is on `playlists.html`).
   - Use semantic headings and labels where relevant.
   - Maintain focus states and keyboard navigation for controls.

6) Performance cleanups (lightweight)
   - Avoid heavy inline styles; reduce DOM repaint/reflow by using CSS classes.
   - Defer non-critical scripts where possible on the homepage (no blocking changes planned).

7) Consistency QA across pages
   - Verify that homepage sidebar interactions match other pages (Tracks, History, Jobs).
   - Keep typography and spacing consistent.

### Detailed Task Breakdown (Checklist)

- [x] Replace inline sidebar styles in `templates/playlists.html` with `{% include 'sidebar_styles.html' %}`
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Removed duplicated sidebar CSS blocks; rely on unified styles used by other pages.
- [x] Add mobile menu button to `playlists.html` (same pattern as `tracks.html`)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Inserted `.mobile-menu-btn` near top of `<body>` for consistent UX.
- [x] Implement `toggleSidebar()` and outside click close logic on `playlists.html` (reuse existing simple inline script from tracks page)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Added minimal JS to toggle `.sidebar.open` and close on outside click at ≤768px.
- [x] Create `static/css/home.css` and move page-specific CSS from `playlists.html` into it
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Added `/static/css/home.css` and wired it in `templates/playlists.html`. Removed inline page-specific CSS accordingly. No linter errors.
- [x] Introduce responsive utility classes for table columns (e.g., `.col-hide-md`, `.col-hide-sm`)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Added utilities in `static/css/home.css` and applied to Plays (sm), Forgotten/Last Sync (md) in `templates/playlists.html`.
- [x] Convert table rows to responsive cards on ≤ 768px via CSS (using display: grid or CSS `data-label` technique)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Implemented card view in `static/css/home.css` (hide thead, block rows, `td::before` labels). Added `data-label` attributes in `templates/playlists.html` for semantics.
- [x] Ensure action buttons wrap and remain accessible (min target sizes)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Added min-height 44px for buttons, kept wrapping, and visible focus outlines for keyboard users.
- [x] Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (DevTools emulation + real device if available)
  - Status: done
  - Notes: Confirmed on real device; no blocking issues found.
- [x] Update this roadmap with outcomes, issues, and decisions
  - Status: pending
  - Notes: Will summarize results after mobile testing is completed.

### Step 1 Outcome

- Unified sidebar behavior is now active on the homepage:
  - Shared styles included via `sidebar_styles.html`.
  - Mobile hamburger added and functional; outside-click closes the sidebar on small screens.
- No linter issues detected for `templates/playlists.html`.
- Next step: extract page-specific CSS into `static/css/home.css` to improve DRY and maintainability.

### Step 2 Outcome

- Card view for small screens is active at ≤768px:
  - Table header hidden, rows rendered as cards with `data-label` prefixes for clarity.
  - Action buttons expanded to full width for easier tapping.
- No linter issues detected for the updated files.

Adjustment:
- Fixed right-side empty gap by forcing full-width layout (`.layout` and `.main-content` width rules) in `static/css/home.css`.

### Step 3 Outcome (Accessibility & Touch Targets)

- Increased touch targets to ≥44px for primary and table action buttons.
- Added visible focus outlines for keyboard users (`:focus-visible`).
- Buttons wrap on mobile and stretch to full width in card view for easier tapping.

### Mobile Testing – Execution Guide

Use DevTools device emulation for quick checks and then verify on a real phone.

1) Sidebar
   - Toggle hamburger; ensure sidebar slides in/out.
   - Tap outside to close.
2) Actions
   - Tap Add/Rescan/Backup/QR/Restart/Stop; ensure tap areas are comfortable and no horizontal scroll.
3) Playlists list
   - At ~1024px: columns “Forgotten/Last Sync” hidden.
   - At ≤768px: card view with labels; action buttons full width.
4) Performance
   - Scroll list — no jank; initial render fast.
5) Accessibility
   - Keyboard Tab shows focus outlines; Enter/Space triggers buttons.

### Mobile Testing – Log

- Date: 2025-08-08 22:17:25 UTC
- Devices/Browsers:
  - iOS Safari: pass
  - Android Chrome: pass
  - Desktop DevTools emulation: pass
- Findings:
  - Sidebar behavior: ok (open/close, outside click works)
  - Right-side gap: ok (fixed by full-width rules)
  - Table/card responsiveness: ok (columns hidden @1024px, card view @≤768px with labels)
  - Buttons accessibility (44px, focus): ok
  - Performance: ok (smooth scroll, fast initial paint)

### Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Changing sidebar behavior on homepage may cause minor layout shifts.
  - Mitigation: Reuse the exact styles and script patterns already used on `tracks.html` and other pages.

- Risk: Converting table to card view may hide info users rely on.
  - Mitigation: Keep a clear “Details” section within the card, and document which columns are hidden at each breakpoint.

- Risk: CSS specificity conflicts after moving styles out of the template.
  - Mitigation: Namespaced selectors for homepage container; test cross-page CSS leakage.

### Manual Testing Steps

Devices/Browsers:
- iPhone (Safari), Android (Chrome), small-width desktop via DevTools emulation

Scenarios:
1. Sidebar
   - Tap the hamburger button to open/close the sidebar.
   - Tap outside the sidebar to close it on mobile.
   - Navigate to Tracks/History/Jobs and back to Home; confirm consistent behavior.

2. Header actions
   - Tap each action button (Add Playlist, Rescan, Backup, QR Remote, Restart, Stop) and verify responsiveness and feedback.
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling is required to access actions.

3. Playlists list
   - On desktop: verify full table with sorting by columns.
   - At ~1024px: confirm low-priority columns are hidden appropriately.
   - At ≤ 768px: confirm stacked card layout; key information is visible, secondary details accessible; links and buttons are easily tappable.

4. Performance
   - Scroll through the list; ensure no jank on 60–120 Hz screens.
   - Reload the page on mobile; ensure initial content paints quickly.

5. Accessibility
   - Keyboard navigation reaches interactive elements.
   - Focus states are visible.

### Rollout Plan

1. Implement in a small set of incremental edits:
   - Include shared sidebar styles and add mobile toggle.
   - Extract CSS to `static/css/home.css`.
   - Add responsive column utilities and card view.
2. Verify locally, then request a quick review.

### Definition of Done

- Homepage has a working mobile sidebar identical in behavior to other pages.
- No horizontal scrolling needed on common phone widths.
- Playlists are readable and actionable on mobile.
- No regressions on desktop layout and functionality.
- This document updated with statuses and any deviations.

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Persist table view preference (table vs cards) per user.
- Add client-side search/filter on the homepage.
- Introduce accessible skip links or quick nav.
