# Extended Metadata Extraction System

## Overview
This feature implements a system to extract extended YouTube metadata (publication dates, view counts, etc.) for tracks that currently lack this information. The system uses a job queue approach with configurable delays to respect YouTube's rate limits.

## Project Status
- **Started:** 2025-07-04 23:44 UTC
- **Current Status:** âœ… **PROJECT COMPLETED** - All phases implemented and tested
- **Completed:** 2025-07-05 00:34 UTC
- **Duration:** ~50 minutes of focused development

## Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Settings Page** (`/settings`) - Configure job execution delays
2. **Metadata Scanner** (`scan_missing_metadata.py`) - Identify tracks needing metadata
3. **Single Video Metadata Worker** - Extract metadata for individual videos
4. **Job Queue Integration** - Manage extraction tasks with delays

### Database Schema
- **Primary Table:** `youtube_video_metadata` (existing, enhanced)
- **Settings Table:** `user_settings` (existing, new setting added)
- **Job Queue:** `job_queue` (existing, new job type added)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Settings System
**Status:** âœ… Completed - 2025-07-04 23:55 UTC

#### Task 1.1: Create Settings Page
- [x] Add `/settings` route to main application

#### Task 4.1: Create Scanner Script
- [x] Create `scan_missing_metadata.py` in project root
- [x] Implement track scanning logic
- [x] Add command line arguments: `--limit`, `--dry-run`
- [x] Create jobs with priority 10

#### Task 4.2: Missing Metadata Detection
- [x] Implement SQL query to find tracks without metadata
- [x] Handle both conditions: no record OR null timestamps
- [x] Exclude deleted tracks from scan

**Detection Logic:**
```sql
SELECT t.video_id 
FROM tracks t 
LEFT JOIN youtube_video_metadata ym ON t.video_id = ym.youtube_id
WHERE t.video_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND (ym.youtube_id IS NULL 
       OR (ym.timestamp IS NULL AND ym.release_timestamp IS NULL))
```

**Command Examples:**
```bash
python scan_missing_metadata.py                    # Scan all
python scan_missing_metadata.py --limit 100        # Limit to 100
python scan_missing_metadata.py --dry-run          # Show stats only
```

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETION SUMMARY

### What Was Built
The **Extended Metadata Extraction System** is now fully operational, providing:

1. **Web Settings Interface** (`/settings`) - Configure extraction delays
2. **Job Queue Integration** - Automatic delay application with logging
3. **Metadata Worker** - Extract individual video metadata via yt-dlp
4. **Scanner Command** - Identify and batch process missing metadata
5. **Complete Documentation** - Usage guides and technical specifications

### Key Features
- âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays (0-86400 seconds) prevent API abuse
- âœ… **Batch Processing**: Process tracks in controlled batches with limits
- âœ… **Dry Run Mode**: Preview operations without making changes
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and detailed logging
- âœ… **Database Integration**: Uses existing tables without schema changes
- âœ… **User Experience**: Web interface + CLI tools for different use cases

### Production Ready
The system is **immediately usable** for extracting YouTube publication dates:

```bash
# Quick Start Commands
python scripts/scan_missing_metadata.py --dry-run          # Preview
python scripts/scan_missing_metadata.py --limit 50         # Start small
# Configure delays at /settings page (recommended: 6 seconds = 10 videos/minute)
# Monitor progress at /jobs page
```

### Architecture Benefits
- **Modular Design**: Each component can be used independently
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new metadata fields or processing types
- **Scalable**: Handles small datasets to large collections efficiently
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and comprehensive logging
- **User-Friendly**: Both technical (CLI) and non-technical (web) interfaces

### Future Enhancement Ready
The system provides a solid foundation for:
- Additional metadata fields (view counts, like counts, etc.)
- Automated scheduling and periodic updates
- Advanced processing strategies
- Integration with external metadata sources
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Technical Specifications

### Settings Configuration
- **Setting Key:** `job_execution_delay_seconds`
- **Data Type:** Integer
- **Range:** 0 to 86400 (24 hours)
- **Default:** 0 (no delay)
- **Validation:** Must be non-negative integer

### Job Queue Integration
- **Job Type:** `extract_video_metadata`
- **Priority:** 10 (lowest priority)
- **Retry Policy:** No automatic retries
- **Delay Application:** Before each job execution

### Metadata Extraction
- **Tool:** yt-dlp with `--dump-json`
- **Target:** Single video URLs
- **Output:** Full metadata to `youtube_video_metadata` table
- **Fallback:** Update `tracks.published_date` from timestamp

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **YouTube API Errors:** Mark job as failed, log error
2. **Network Timeouts:** Mark job as failed, log error
3. **Invalid Video IDs:** Mark job as failed, log error
4. **Database Errors:** Mark job as failed, log error

### Logging Strategy
- **Info Level:** Job creation, successful extractions
- **Warning Level:** Delay applications, retries
- **Error Level:** Failed extractions, system errors

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable delays between job executions
- Prevents YouTube API rate limiting
- Allows for burst protection

### Resource Usage
- Single video processing reduces memory usage
- Job queue provides natural throttling
- Low priority ensures other operations aren't blocked

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Job type-specific delay settings
- [ ] Adaptive delay based on API response times
- [ ] Batch processing option for efficiency
- [ ] Metadata refresh scheduling
- [ ] Health monitoring and alerting

### Integration Opportunities
- [ ] Channel-specific metadata extraction
- [ ] Playlist metadata enhancement
- [ ] Automated metadata updates
