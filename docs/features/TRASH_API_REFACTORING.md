# Feature: Trash API Refactoring

## 🎯 Goal

Extract trash management functionality into a separate API module `trash_api.py` to improve architectural consistency, apply the Single Responsibility Principle, and enable future expansion of trash functionality.

## 📊 Status

- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅
- **Progress:** 12/12 tasks completed (100% finished)  
- **Start Date:** 2025-07-05
- **Completion Date:** 2025-07-05

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Current State:
```
channels_api.py
├── GET /api/deleted_tracks      (logically related to trash)
├── POST /api/restore_track      (logically related to trash)
├── GET /api/trash_stats         (logically related to trash)
├── POST /api/clear_trash        (logically related to trash)
└── POST /api/delete_track       (remains in channels_api.py)
```

### Target State:
```
trash_api.py (NEW)                      channels_api.py
├── GET /api/deleted_tracks             ├── POST /api/delete_track
├── POST /api/restore_track       ◄──── │   (imports trash utilities)
├── GET /api/trash_stats                └── other channel methods
├── POST /api/clear_trash
├── GET /api/trash/browse (FUTURE)
└── POST /api/trash/partial_clear (FUTURE)
```

### Components:
- **TrashAPI Blueprint** - separate Flask blueprint for trash operations
- **Trash Utilities** - helper functions for trash operations
- **Database Integration** - methods for working with `deleted_tracks` table
- **Cross-module Communication** - connection between `channels_api.py` and `trash_api.py`

## ✅ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Analysis of current trash method dependencies
- [x] ✅ Define interface for module interaction
- [x] ✅ Plan `trash_api.py` structure
- [x] ✅ Create list of utility functions

### Phase 2: New Module Creation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Create `controllers/api/trash_api.py` with Flask blueprint
- [x] ✅ Set up routing and basic structure
- [x] ✅ Create basic imports and shared dependencies
- [x] ✅ Add error handling and logging

### Phase 3: API Method Migration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Move `GET /api/deleted_tracks` to `trash_api.py`
- [x] ✅ Move `POST /api/restore_track` to `trash_api.py`  
- [x] ✅ Move `GET /api/trash_stats` to `trash_api.py`
- [x] ✅ Move `POST /api/clear_trash` to `trash_api.py`

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Register trash_api blueprint in main app
- [x] ✅ Update imports in `channels_api.py` for `delete_track`
- [x] ✅ Test all endpoints after migration
- [x] ✅ Update documentation and navigation

## 📁 Files

### New Files
- `controllers/api/trash_api.py` - main trash API module
- `docs/features/TRASH_API_REFACTORING.md` - current plan (this file)

### Modified Files  
- `controllers/api/channels_api.py` - remove trash methods, update imports
- `app.py` - register new blueprint
- `controllers/api/__init__.py` - possible export updates
- `templates/deleted.html` - verify API call correctness (if needed)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Methods to Migrate:

1. **`GET /api/deleted_tracks`**
   - Get list of deleted tracks with filtering
   - Group channels for filters
   - Dependencies: `db.get_deleted_tracks()`, `get_connection()`

2. **`POST /api/restore_track`**  
   - Restore deleted track
   - Support methods: file/redownload
   - Dependencies: `db.restore_deleted_track()`

3. **`GET /api/trash_stats`**
   - Trash statistics (size, file count)
   - Recursive file counting
   - Dependencies: `get_root_dir()`, `_format_file_size()`

4. **`POST /api/clear_trash`**
   - Clear all files from trash
   - Update database flags
   - Dependencies: `get_root_dir()`, `get_connection()`

### Shared utilities (remain available to both modules):
- `get_connection()` - database connection
- `get_root_dir()` - get root folder  
- `log_message()` - logging
- `_format_file_size()` - format file size

### Blueprint Configuration:
```python
# controllers/api/trash_api.py
trash_bp = Blueprint('trash_api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')

# app.py  
from controllers.api.trash_api import trash_bp
app.register_blueprint(trash_bp)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Scenarios:
1. **API Endpoints** - all methods work after migration
2. **Cross-module Integration** - `delete_track` works correctly with new module
3. **Error Handling** - error handling unchanged
4. **Performance** - performance not degraded
5. **Frontend Compatibility** - web interface works without changes

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] `GET /api/deleted_tracks` returns correct data
- [ ] `POST /api/restore_track` restores tracks  
- [ ] `GET /api/trash_stats` shows correct statistics
- [ ] `POST /api/clear_trash` clears trash and updates DB
- [ ] `POST /api/delete_track` from channels_api continues working
- [ ] Web interface `/deleted` functions completely
- [ ] Logging works correctly
- [ ] Error handling not broken

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Possibilities

After successful refactoring, it becomes easier to add:

### Additional API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/trash/browse/{channel}` - browse trash by channels
- `POST /api/trash/partial_clear` - partial clearing (by dates/channels)  
- `GET /api/trash/size_by_channel` - statistics by channels
- `POST /api/trash/auto_cleanup` - automatic cleanup of old files
- `GET /api/trash/export` - export list of deleted tracks

### UI/UX Improvements:
- Trash browser with tree structure
- Bulk restoration by filters
- Drag & drop for restoration
- Visualization of space usage by channels

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Architectural Principles:
- **Single Responsibility** - each module handles its own area
- **Loose Coupling** - minimal dependencies between modules  
- **High Cohesion** - related functionality in one place
- **Extensibility** - ease of adding new functions

### Important Points:
- Maintain full backward API compatibility
- Don't break existing deletion functionality  
- Minimize changes in frontend code
- Ensure correct logging and error handling

### Execution Order:
1. First create new module by copying methods
2. Test new module independently
3. Update blueprint registration in app
4. Remove methods from channels_api.py only after full testing
5. Clean up unused imports
