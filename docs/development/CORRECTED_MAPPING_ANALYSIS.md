# Corrected Mapping Analysis

## Issue Discovered
The timestamp corrections made earlier were based on incomplete git history analysis. The project actually started on **2025-06-16**, not 2025-06-19 as previously assumed.

## Actual Project Timeline
- **Project Start:** 2025-06-16 03:29:20 +0300 (Initial import)
- **Development Period:** 2025-06-16 to 2025-06-21 (6 days intensive development)
- **Total Commits:** 72 commits (not 15 as analyzed earlier)

## Impact on Development Log Entries

### Problem with Current Mapping
Many log entries that describe foundational work (like Entry #001 template fixes) are currently mapped to very late commits, which doesn't make chronological sense.

### Need for Re-Analysis
The development log entries need to be re-examined to match them with commits that actually correspond to the described work, considering the full 6-day development timeline.

## Recommendation
1. **Analyze entry content** to understand what work was actually done
2. **Match with appropriate commits** from the full 72-commit history
3. **Consider development phases** - foundational work should map to early commits
4. **Maintain logical progression** - entries should follow natural development order

## Key Insight
The development log entries were likely created as retrospective documentation, trying to capture the evolution of a project that had already been developed over 6 days. This explains why the timestamps were placeholders rather than real-time entries.
