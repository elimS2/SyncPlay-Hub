# Development Log Entry #093

## Summary
Implementation of automated daily database backup system with configurable retention

---

### Log Entry #093 - 2025-06-30 00:22 UTC
**Change:** Implemented automated daily database backup system

#### Files Modified
- `services/job_workers/backup_worker.py` - New worker for executing database backup tasks
- `services/auto_backup_service.py` - New service for scheduling automatic daily backups 
- `services/job_workers/__init__.py` - Added BackupWorker export
- `controllers/api/backup_api.py` - New API endpoints for backup management
- `controllers/api/__init__.py` - Registered backup API blueprint
- `app.py` - Integrated BackupWorker and AutoBackupService into main application
- `templates/backups.html` - Added comprehensive UI for automatic backup configuration

#### Reason for Change
User requested automated daily backups instead of manual backup creation. The system needed to:
1. Automatically create database backups once per day
2. Allow configuration of schedule time and retention period
3. Provide management interface for monitoring and control
4. Integrate with existing job queue system for reliability
5. Optional cleanup of old backups based on user preference

#### What Changed

**In `services/job_workers/backup_worker.py`:**
- **New BackupWorker class** implementing JobWorker interface
- **Supported job type:** `DATABASE_BACKUP`
- **Features:** 
  - Daily backup scheduling with duplicate prevention
  - Optional cleanup of old backups (disabled by default)
  - Integration with existing `create_backup()` function
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling
  - Configurable backup parameters (retention_days, cleanup_old, force_backup)

**In `services/auto_backup_service.py`:**
- **New AutoBackupService class** for scheduling automation
- **Configuration options:**
  - `enabled`: Enable/disable automatic backups (default: True)
  - `schedule_time`: Daily backup time in HH:MM UTC format (default: "02:00")
  - `retention_days`: Days to keep backups (default: 30)
  - `check_interval`: Minutes between schedule checks (default: 60)
- **Features:**
  - Background scheduler thread with graceful shutdown
  - Prevents duplicate backups on same day
  - Force backup functionality for manual triggers
  - Status monitoring and configuration updates
  - Integration with job queue system
  - **Cleanup disabled by default** to preserve all backups

**In `controllers/api/backup_api.py`:**
- **New API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/backup_status` - Get auto backup service status
  - `GET /api/backup_config` - Get current configuration
  - `POST /api/backup_config` - Update configuration with validation
  - `POST /api/backup_force` - Force immediate backup creation
  - `GET /api/backup_jobs` - List recent backup jobs
  - `GET /api/backup_job/<id>` - Get job details
  - `POST /api/backup_job/<id>/cancel` - Cancel pending job
- **Validation:** Time format, retention limits, interval constraints
- **Logging:** All configuration changes and operations

**In `app.py`:**
- **BackupWorker registration** in job queue service
- **AutoBackupService startup** with default configuration:
  - Daily backups at 2:00 AM UTC
  - 30-day retention period (for reference only)
  - Hourly schedule checks
  - **No automatic cleanup** by default
- **Graceful shutdown** of auto backup service

**In `templates/backups.html`:**
- **New "Automatic Backups" section** with status display
- **Configuration modal** for all settings with validation
- **Management buttons:**
  - "‚öôÔ∏è Configure" - Open configuration modal
  - "üöÄ Force Backup Now" - Trigger immediate backup
  - "üìã View Jobs" - Show recent backup job history
- **Status indicators:** Enabled/disabled, running/stopped, next backup time
- **Jobs modal** with sortable table showing job history and status

#### Technical Implementation

**Backup Scheduling Logic:**
1. AutoBackupService runs background thread checking every hour
2. Compares current time with configured schedule_time
3. Prevents duplicate backups by tracking last_backup_date
4. Creates DATABASE_BACKUP job in job queue when conditions met
5. BackupWorker executes job using existing backup infrastructure

**Job Queue Integration:**
- Uses existing JobType.DATABASE_BACKUP enum value
- BackupWorker implements JobWorker interface
- Supports retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging through job logging system
- Status tracking through job queue API

**Configuration Management:**
- Runtime configuration updates without restart
- Service restart when enabled state changes
- Input validation for all configuration parameters
- Persistent configuration through service singleton

**User Interface Features:**
- Real-time status updates showing service state
- Modal-based configuration with form validation
- Job history with status indicators and timing info
- Responsive design consistent with existing UI theme

#### Impact Analysis
- **‚úÖ Automation:** Database automatically backed up daily without user intervention
- **‚úÖ Reliability:** Integrates with robust job queue system with retry logic
- **‚úÖ Configurability:** Full control over schedule, retention, and monitoring
- **‚úÖ User Experience:** Comprehensive web interface for management
- **‚úÖ Preservation:** All backups preserved by default (no automatic deletion)
- **‚úÖ Monitoring:** Real-time status and job history visibility
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Resource Usage:** Minimal additional CPU/memory for background scheduler
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies:** Requires job queue service to be running
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Storage:** Backups accumulate over time without automatic cleanup

#### Configuration Options
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule_time": "02:00",
  "retention_days": 30,
  "check_interval": 60
}
```

**Note:** `retention_days` is for reference only. Automatic cleanup is disabled by default to preserve all backups.

#### API Endpoints Added
- **GET** `/api/backup_status` - Service status and configuration
- **GET/POST** `/api/backup_config` - Configuration management
- **POST** `/api/backup_force` - Manual backup trigger
- **GET** `/api/backup_jobs` - Job history and monitoring
- **GET/POST** `/api/backup_job/<id>` - Individual job management

#### Verification Checklist
- [x] BackupWorker properly registered and functional
- [x] AutoBackupService starts with application
- [x] Daily backup scheduling works correctly
- [x] Configuration UI updates service settings
- [x] Force backup creates immediate job
- [x] Job history displays correctly
- [x] Automatic cleanup disabled by default
- [x] API endpoints return expected responses
- [x] UI modals and forms validate input
- [x] Service gracefully shuts down with application
- [x] All code uses English language only

#### Update - 2025-06-30 00:33 UTC
**Change:** Fixed confusing "Retention: 30 days" display in backup interface

**Problem:** User reported that "Retention: 30 days" text on backup status page was misleading since automatic cleanup is disabled by default.

**Solution:**
- **Status Display:** Changed "Retention: 30 days" ‚Üí "Auto-cleanup: ‚ùå Disabled" 
- **Configuration Modal:** Removed "Retention (days)" input field entirely
- **JavaScript Updates:** 
  - Removed references to deleted `retentionDaysInput` field
  - Set fixed `retention_days: 30` value (not used for actual cleanup)

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/backups.html` - Updated status display and removed retention configuration field

**Result:** Interface now clearly shows automatic cleanup is disabled, eliminating user confusion.
