# Development Log #112 - URL Format Consistency Fix

### Log Entry #112 - 2025-07-01 00:25 UTC

**Context**: URL Mismatch Fix - Channel URL Format Consistency

**Changes Made**:

1. **Fixed URL Format Mismatch in Metadata Extraction**:
   - **File**: `scripts/extract_channel_metadata.py`
   - **Issue**: Smart extraction with date filter returns technical URLs (`https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxx`), but callback searches for human-readable URLs (`@ChannelName`), causing database search mismatches
   - **Solution**: Modified `process_channel_metadata()` to always save the original human-readable URL passed to function, regardless of what yt-dlp returns in metadata
   - **Change**: 
     ```python
     # OLD: Conditional assignment
     if not metadata.get('channel_url'):
         metadata['channel_url'] = url
         
     # NEW: Always use original URL
     metadata['channel_url'] = url
     ```

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Positive**: 
  - Fixes URL mismatch causing callback to find 0 videos despite successful metadata extraction
  - Ensures consistent human-readable URL format in database for all extraction methods
  - Should resolve issue where smart extraction jobs create metadata but callbacks fail to create download jobs
  
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk - change only affects how URL is stored, doesn't change extraction logic

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/extract_channel_metadata.py` - URL assignment logic fix

**Next Steps**:
- Test with new metadata extraction job to verify callback system works correctly
- Monitor job queue to confirm download jobs are created after metadata extraction

**Technical Notes**:
- Root cause was URL format inconsistency between extraction and callback search phases
- Smart extraction uses different yt-dlp commands that may return different URL formats in metadata
- Original passed URL is always the correct human-readable format for database consistency
