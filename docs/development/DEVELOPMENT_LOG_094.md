### Log Entry #094 - 2025-06-30 16:05 UTC

**FEATURE: Implemented Automatic Random Cookie Selection System**

**Affected Files:**
- NEW: `utils/cookies_manager.py` - Core cookie management utility
- MODIFIED: `download_playlist.py` - Integrated automatic cookie selection
- MODIFIED: `download_content.py` - Integrated automatic cookie selection  
- MODIFIED: `services/job_workers/playlist_download_worker.py` - Added cookie support to job system
- MODIFIED: `scripts/ENV_SETUP.md` - Added YOUTUBE_COOKIES_DIR documentation
- MODIFIED: `README.md` - Added comprehensive documentation for new cookie system

**New Functionality:**
1. **Environment Variable Support**: `YOUTUBE_COOKIES_DIR` environment variable for cookie folder configuration
2. **Automatic Cookie Discovery**: Finds cookie files using patterns (*.txt, *.cookies, youtube*.txt, *.json)
3. **Smart Validation**: Validates cookie files for YouTube-specific content before use
4. **Random Selection**: Randomly selects from valid cookie files to distribute load across accounts
5. **Priority System**: Explicit cookies > Browser cookies > Random cookies > No cookies
6. **Job Queue Integration**: Seamless integration with existing job worker system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `CookiesManager` utility class with comprehensive validation
- Integrated with all download scripts using priority-based selection
- Added fallback mechanisms for backward compatibility
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities
- Maintains existing command-line interface while adding automation

**User Benefits:**
- Automatic cookie rotation reduces account blocking risks  
- Simple setup: just place cookie files in configured directory
- Backward compatible with existing cookie workflows
- Solves "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors automatically
- Works with job queue system for background downloads

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Add to .env file:
YOUTUBE_COOKIES_DIR=D:/music/Youtube/Cookies
```

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Automatic cookie selection (NEW)
python download_playlist.py <URL>

# Explicit cookie (still supported)  
python download_playlist.py <URL> --cookies path/to/cookies.txt

# Browser cookies (still supported)
python download_playlist.py <URL> --use-browser-cookies
```

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Cookie detection and validation working correctly
- ✅ Random selection from valid cookie files  
- ✅ Integration with job queue system successful
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing workflows maintained
- ✅ "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors resolved

**Development Notes:**
- Follows existing project patterns for configuration and logging
- Uses pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- Extensive documentation added to README.md
- Integration tested with both playlist and content download systems

**Previous Commit:** c585f68 - fix: Disable automatic backup cleanup and fix language compliance

**Next Steps:**
- Performance monitoring of random selection
- Potential integration with channel management system
- User feedback collection on cookie rotation effectiveness

**Rule Compliance:**
✅ All code written in English  
✅ Development log updated in separate file (corrected)  
✅ Time verified using UTC timestamp tool  
✅ Git commit checked for PROJECT_HISTORY.md synchronization
