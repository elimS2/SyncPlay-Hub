## ðŸŽ¯ What Changed

**Summary:** Removed duplicate player control buttons from virtual playlist pages

**Changes Made:**
- Hidden duplicate player control buttons (Prev, Play, Next, Stop) from the top control bar on virtual playlist pages
- Refactored JavaScript functionality to use direct functions instead of button references
- Updated all integrations to use new direct functions

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/likes_player.html` - Added `style="display: none;"` to buttons with IDs: `prevBtn`, `playBtn`, `nextBtn`, `stopBtn`
- `static/player-virtual.js` - Refactored from button references to direct functions

---

## ðŸ¤” Why Changed

**User Request:** After removing duplicate controls from regular playlist pages, user requested same changes for virtual player

**Problem:** Virtual player had same issue - duplicate control buttons at top of page that replicated bottom player controls

**Solution:** Applied same approach as regular player - hide buttons via CSS, refactor JavaScript to use direct functions

---

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

**HTML Changes:**
- Added `style="display: none;"` to 4 buttons in `templates/likes_player.html`
- Buttons remain in DOM to maintain JavaScript compatibility
- Visual clutter removed from virtual playlist pages

**JavaScript Refactoring:**
- Removed button references: `prevBtn`, `playBtn`, `nextBtn`, `stopBtn`
- Created direct functions: `stopPlayback()`, `nextTrack()`, `prevTrack()`, `togglePlayback()`
- Updated bottom controls to use direct functions instead of button proxying
- Updated keyboard shortcuts to use direct functions
- Updated Media Session API handlers to use direct functions
- Updated remote control commands to use direct functions
- Updated function overrides for remote sync

**Integration Points Updated:**
1. **Bottom Controls:** `cPrev.onclick = () => prevTrack()` (instead of `prevBtn.click()`)
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Arrow keys and Space bar use direct functions
3. **Media Session API:** Browser media controls use direct functions
4. **Remote Control:** Remote commands use direct functions
5. **Video Click:** Uses `togglePlayback()` instead of `togglePlay()`
