# Development Log Entry #075

**Date:** 2025-06-28 20:19 UTC  
**Entry Number:** #075  
**Change:** Enhanced Track Deletion - Added Delete Button to Control Bar

---

## Problem Addressed

**User Request:** Add delete button to the top control bar that deletes the currently playing track and automatically switches to the next track.

**Context:** Following successful implementation of track deletion functionality in Entry #074, user requested additional convenience feature for quick deletion of currently playing track without needing to locate it in the playlist.

## Files Modified

- `templates/index.html` - Added delete button to top control bar
- `static/player.js` - Added delete button handler and current track deletion logic

## Reason for Change

**User Experience Enhancement:** Providing immediate access to delete functionality for the currently playing track:
- **Quick Access:** Users don't need to scroll through playlist to find current track
- **Seamless Workflow:** Delete current track while it's playing and continue with next track
- **Consistent Interface:** Same deletion safety features as individual track deletion
- **Efficient Navigation:** Automatic playback continuation after deletion

## What Changed

### 1. Control Bar Button Addition (`templates/index.html`)

**New Delete Button Added:**
```html
<button id="deleteCurrentBtn" class="modern-btn modern-btn-danger">
  <svg width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2">
    <polyline points="3,6 5,6 21,6"></polyline>
    <path d="M19,6V20a2,2 0 0,1 -2,2H7a2,2 0 0,1 -2,-2V6M8,6V4a2,2 0 0,1 2,-2h4a2,2 0 0,1 2,2V6"></path>
    <line x1="10" y1="11" x2="10" y2="17"></line>
    <line x1="14" y1="11" x2="14" y2="17"></line>
  </svg>
  <span>Delete</span>
</button>
```

**Key Features:**
- **Visual Design:** Modern danger-styled button with trash can SVG icon
- **Positioning:** Placed between Stop and Stream buttons in control bar
- **Consistent Styling:** Matches existing `modern-btn` design system
- **Clear Icon:** Detailed trash can SVG with lid and deletion lines

### 2. JavaScript Handler Implementation (`static/player.js`)

**Button Element Reference:**
```javascript
const deleteCurrentBtn = document.getElementById('deleteCurrentBtn');
```

**Complete Delete Handler:**
```javascript
deleteCurrentBtn.onclick = async () => {
  // Validation, confirmation, API call, state management
}
```

**Handler Features:**
- **Track Validation:** Checks if current track exists before deletion
- **User Confirmation:** Russian language confirmation dialog with track name
- **API Integration:** Uses existing `/api/delete_track` endpoint
- **State Management:** Updates both `queue` and `tracks` arrays
- **Playback Continuity:** Automatically plays next track or handles empty playlist
- **UI Updates:** Refreshes playlist display and shows notifications
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios

### 3. Smart Playback Continuation Logic

**Automatic Track Switching:**
- **Normal Case:** Continues with track at same index position (next track takes place of deleted one)
- **End of Playlist:** Switches to first track if last track was deleted
- **Empty Playlist:** Stops playback and shows informative message
- **State Consistency:** Maintains proper `currentIndex` and player state

**Track Array Management:**
- **Queue Update:** Removes track from current shuffle queue
- **Original Update:** Removes track from original tracks array  
- **Index Adjustment:** No index adjustment needed (deleted track replaced by next)
- **Render Update:** Updates playlist UI to reflect changes

### 4. Enhanced User Experience Features

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```javascript
const confirmMessage = `–£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å —Ç–µ–∫—É—â–∏–π —Ç—Ä–µ–∫ "${currentTrack.name.replace(/\s*\[.*?\]$/, '')}" –∏–∑ –ø–ª–µ–π–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∞?\n\n–¢—Ä–µ–∫ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ—â–µ–Ω –≤ –∫–æ—Ä–∑–∏–Ω—É –∏ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω.`;
```

**Status Notifications:**
- **Success:** `‚úÖ –¢—Ä–µ–∫ —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω: [detailed message]`
- **Error States:** Network errors, API failures, validation errors
- **Info Messages:** Empty playlist notification
- **Russian Language:** All user-facing messages in Russian

**Edge Case Handling:**
- **No Active Track:** Shows appropriate error message
- **Network Failures:** Graceful error handling with user notification
- **Empty Playlist:** Informative message about playlist being empty
- **Playback State:** Proper handling of media player state after deletion
