# Development Log Entry #074

**Date:** 2025-06-28 20:10 UTC  
**Entry Number:** #074  
**Change:** Implemented Track Deletion from Playlists with Trash Functionality

---

## Problem Addressed

**User Request:** Add delete button functionality to playlist pages for removing tracks from playlists. Tracks should be moved to trash folder structure `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\Trash\–∏–º—è_–∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª–∞_–∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∞_–≤–∏–¥–µ–æ` and deletion events should be recorded in the database for potential restoration.

## Files Modified

- `controllers/api_controller.py` - Added `/api/delete_track` endpoint for track deletion
- `static/player.js` - Added delete buttons to track list and deletion handling logic

## Reason for Change

**Feature Enhancement:** Users needed ability to manually remove unwanted tracks from playlists through the web interface:
- **Safety Requirement:** Tracks should be moved to recoverable trash instead of permanent deletion
- **Organization Requirement:** Trash should maintain channel-based folder structure
- **Database Integration:** Deletion events must be recorded for restoration interface
- **User Experience:** Simple one-click deletion with confirmation and visual feedback

## What Changed

### 1. New API Endpoint - `/api/delete_track` (POST)

```python
@api_bp.route("/delete_track", methods=["POST"])
def api_delete_track():
    """Delete a track from playlist by moving it to trash."""
```

**Key Features:**
- **Input Validation:** Requires `video_id` parameter
- **Database Lookup:** Finds track details in database using `video_id`
- **File Verification:** Checks that physical file exists before deletion
- **Channel Detection:** Extracts channel name from file path for trash organization
- **Trash Structure:** Creates `ROOT_DIR/Playlists/Trash/channel_name/` directories
- **Conflict Handling:** Adds timestamps to avoid filename conflicts in trash
- **Database Recording:** Uses existing `record_track_deletion()` and `record_event()` functions
- **Response Data:** Returns deletion status, trash path, and success message

### 2. Enhanced Track List UI in `player.js`

**Modified `renderList()` Function:**
- **Layout Change:** Converted from simple text to flex layout with track info and delete button
- **Track Info Container:** Clickable area for track selection
- **Delete Button:** üóëÔ∏è emoji button with hover effects and confirmation
- **Visual Styling:** Red color theme, opacity transitions, hover feedback

**New `deleteTrack()` Function:**
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Russian language confirmation with track name
- **API Integration:** Sends DELETE request to `/api/delete_track` endpoint
- **Queue Management:** Removes track from both `queue` and `tracks` arrays
- **Playback Handling:** Adjusts current track index and handles currently playing track deletion
- **Auto-Advance:** Continues playback with next track if current track deleted
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages and network failure handling

**New `showNotification()` Function:**
- **Toast Notifications:** Animated slide-in notifications from top-right
- **Type Support:** Success (green), error (red), info (blue) message types
- **Auto-Dismiss:** 5-second auto-hide with fade-out animation
- **Responsive Design:** Proper positioning and styling

### 3. Trash Folder Organization

**Channel Name Extraction Logic:**
- **Channel Tracks:** Extracts from `Channel-ArtistName` pattern in file path
- **Regular Playlists:** Uses playlist folder name as channel identifier
- **Fallback:** Uses "Unknown" for unidentifiable sources

**Trash Directory Structure:**
```
D:\music\Youtube\
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlists\
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ New Music\
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Song [ID].mp3
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Trash\
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ArtistName\          # Channel-based organization
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Song [ID].mp3
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Song_20250628_201000 [ID].mp3  # Timestamped conflicts
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PlaylistName\        # Regular playlist tracks
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Track [ID].mp3
```

### 4. Database Integration

**Deletion Recording:**
- **Table:** Uses existing `deleted_tracks` table
- **Fields:** `video_id`, `original_name`, `original_relpath`, `deletion_reason`, `channel_group`, `trash_path`
- **Event Logging:** Records 'removed' event in `play_history` table
- **Restoration Support:** Supports existing restoration interface at `/deleted` page

## Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ User Experience
