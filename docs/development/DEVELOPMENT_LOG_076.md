# Development Log Entry #076

**Date:** 2025-06-28 20:32 UTC  
**Entry Number:** #076  
**Change:** Fixed Current Track Deletion File Lock Issue & Enhanced Trash Diagnostics

---

## Problem Addressed

**User Report:** When deleting currently playing track using the control bar delete button, the system failed with:
```
❌ Ошибка удаления: Failed to move file to trash: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
```

**Additional Issue:** User couldn't locate deleted tracks in trash folder, requesting verification of trash folder creation and file movement.

## Root Cause Analysis

### File Lock Issue
**Problem:** Media player keeps the currently playing file open with an exclusive lock, preventing file system operations.

**Technical Details:**
- Windows locks files when they're being accessed by media players
- `shutil.move()` cannot move files that are currently open
- The control bar delete button didn't release the file before attempting deletion
- Individual track delete buttons worked because they weren't for currently playing tracks

### Trash Folder Verification  
**Investigation:** User reported not seeing previously deleted tracks in trash.

**Findings:**
- Trash folder structure exists: `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\Trash\`
- Channel subfolders are created but may have naming issues
- Insufficient logging for debugging trash organization

## Files Modified

- `static/player.js` - Enhanced current track deletion with file release logic
- `controllers/api_controller.py` - Added comprehensive trash operation logging

## What Changed

### 1. File Lock Release Logic (`static/player.js`)

**Critical Fix - Media Release Sequence:**
```javascript
// CRITICAL: First pause and clear media source to release file lock
media.pause();
const currentTime = media.currentTime; // Save position for potential restore
media.src = ''; // This releases the file lock
media.load(); // Ensure the media element is properly reset

console.log('🔓 Media file released, proceeding with deletion...');

// Give a small delay to ensure file is fully released
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));
```

**Key Features:**
- **Pause First:** Stops playback to prepare for file release
- **Save Position:** Preserves current playback position for error recovery
- **Clear Source:** `media.src = ''` releases the file lock
- **Reset Element:** `media.load()` ensures proper media element state
- **Wait Period:** 200ms delay allows file system to fully release the file
- **Proceed Safely:** Only then attempt the API deletion call

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery (`static/player.js`)

**Restoration Logic on Failure:**
```javascript
// On failure, try to restore playback of the same track
console.log('🔄 Attempting to restore playback after deletion failure...');
try {
  loadTrack(currentIndex, true);
  if (currentTime && isFinite(currentTime)) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      media.currentTime = currentTime; // Restore position
    }, 500);
  }
} catch (restoreError) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Could not restore playback:', restoreError);
}
```

**Features:**
- **Automatic Recovery:** Restores playback if deletion fails
- **Position Recovery:** Returns to exact playback position
- **Network Error Handling:** Same recovery for network failures
- **Graceful Degradation:** Logs warnings if recovery fails

### 3. Comprehensive Trash Diagnostics (`controllers/api_controller.py`)

**Enhanced Logging for Debugging:**
```python
log_message(f"[Delete] Analyzing track path: {track_relpath}")
# ... channel extraction logic ...
log_message(f"[Delete] Extracted channel name from Channel- pattern: {channel_name}")
log_message(f"[Delete] Final channel name for trash: {channel_name}")
```

**Diagnostic Improvements:**
- **Path Analysis:** Logs the original track relative path
- **Pattern Matching:** Shows channel name extraction process
- **Final Decision:** Confirms the channel name used for trash folder
- **Failure Detection:** Logs when pattern matching fails
- **Fallback Logic:** Shows when playlist name is used as channel name

### 4. Improved Playback Continuity (`static/player.js`)

**Smart Track Progression:**
```javascript
// Handle playback continuation
if (queue.length > 0) {
  const nextIndex = currentIndex < queue.length ? currentIndex : 0;
  console.log(`🎵 Auto-continuing to next track at index ${nextIndex}`);
  playIndex(nextIndex);
} else {
  currentIndex = -1;
  showNotification('📭 Плейлист пуст - все треки удалены', 'info');
}
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Index Management:** Proper handling when deleted track is at end of queue
- **Auto-Continuation:** Seamless progression to next track
- **Empty Playlist:** Clear messaging when no tracks remain
- **State Consistency:** Proper currentIndex management

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Release Sequence
1. **Pause Playback:** Stop media player to prepare for file release
2. **Save State:** Preserve current playback position for recovery
3. **Clear Source:** Remove file reference from media element
4. **Reset Element:** Ensure media element is in clean state
5. **Wait Period:** Allow file system to fully release file locks
6. **API Call:** Proceed with deletion request to server
7. **Handle Result:** Process success/failure and manage playback state

### Error Handling Matrix
| Scenario | Pre-Deletion | Post-Failure Action | User Feedback |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| File in use | Release file lock | Continue deletion | Success notification |
| API failure | File released | Restore playback | Error notification + restoration |
| Network error | File released | Restore playback | Network error + restoration |
| Empty playlist | File released | Stop playback | Empty playlist notification |

### Trash Folder Diagnostics
| Log Entry | Purpose | Information Provided |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Path Analysis | Debug track location | Original relative path |
| Pattern Matching | Channel extraction | Found channel name pattern |
| Extraction Result | Channel identification | Final channel name for trash |
| Failure Detection | Error tracking | When pattern matching fails |

## Troubleshooting Guide

### For Users Unable to Find Deleted Files

1. **Check Trash Structure:**
   ```
   D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\Trash\
   ├── [ChannelName]\        # Channel tracks
   ├── [PlaylistName]\       # Regular playlist tracks
   └── Unknown\              # Unidentified sources
   ```

2. **Check Server Logs:**
   - Look for `[Delete]` entries showing path analysis
   - Verify channel name extraction results
   - Confirm final trash folder decisions

3. **Verify Channel Name Patterns:**
   - Channel tracks: `Channel-ArtistName` pattern
   - Regular playlists: Use playlist folder name
   - Unknown sources: Fallback to "Unknown" folder

1. **Enable Detailed Logging:** All deletion operations now log comprehensive details
2. **Check File Locks:** Verify media player state before deletion attempts  
3. **Verify Permissions:** Ensure write access to trash directory structure
