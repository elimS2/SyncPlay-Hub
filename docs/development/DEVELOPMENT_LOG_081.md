## Session: Job Queue CHECK Constraint Fix

### Log Entry #001 - 2025-06-29 08:38 UTC

**Files Modified:**
- `database/migrations/migration_003_add_missing_job_statuses.py` (created)

**Problem Fixed:**
Fixed critical CHECK constraint error in job_queue table that was causing worker failures:
```
Worker JobWorker-1 error: CHECK constraint failed: status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')
```

**Root Cause:**
The job_queue table CHECK constraint only allowed 5 statuses:
- `'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'`

But the job system code (JobStatus enum) used 9 statuses:
- `'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'` (allowed)
- `'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie'` (blocked by constraint)

When `_cleanup_zombie_jobs()` tried to mark jobs as 'zombie' status, the database rejected the operation.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created `migration_003_add_missing_job_statuses.py` to update CHECK constraint
2. Updated constraint to allow all 9 statuses used by JobStatus enum
3. Applied migration successfully to database

**Technical Details:**
- SQLite doesn't support modifying CHECK constraints, so recreated table with new constraint
- Preserved all existing data during table recreation
- Recreated all indexes after table update
- Migration supports both up (apply) and down (rollback) operations

**Impact:**
- ✅ Zombie job cleanup now works without errors
- ✅ All JobStatus enum values can be stored in database
- ✅ Worker threads no longer crash on status updates
- ✅ System can properly handle timeout, retrying, dead_letter, and zombie statuses

**Testing:**
- Migration applied successfully
- Database schema updated correctly
- All existing job data preserved
- CHECK constraint now supports: `('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled', 'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie')`

This fix resolves the recurring worker errors and enables proper job lifecycle management with all intended statuses.

## Problem Analysis & Context
**Issue**: Worker threads repeatedly crashing with error:
```
Worker JobWorker-1 error: CHECK constraint failed: status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')
```

**Root Cause**: The job_queue table CHECK constraint only allowed 5 statuses but JobStatus enum in code defined 9 statuses including 'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie'. When `_cleanup_zombie_jobs()` tried to set status to 'zombie', database rejected the operation.

## Database Path Discovery
Initially checked wrong database (database.db in project root), but JobQueueService actually uses different path:
- **Configuration Logic**: JobQueueService checks .env file for DB_PATH, defaults to tracks.db
- **Actual Database**: `D:/music/Youtube/DB/tracks.db` (132KB with 624 jobs)
- **Wrong Database**: `database.db` (40KB, different schema)

## Solution Applied
1. **Created verification script** to check actual database path and schema
2. **Found database mismatch**: 
   - Current CHECK constraint: `status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')`
   - Required statuses: All 9 JobStatus enum values
3. **Applied migration_003_add_missing_job_statuses**:
   - Created migrations table
   - Backed up 624 existing jobs
   - Recreated job_queue table with correct CHECK constraint
   - Restored all job data
   - Added migration record

## Final Result
**✅ CHECK Constraint Fixed**:
```sql
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled', 'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie'))
```

**✅ Job Statistics After Migration**:
- Total jobs: 624 (preserved)
- completed: 445
- failed: 136  
- running: 7
- pending: 25
- cancelled: 11

## Files Modified
- Applied migration to: `D:/music/Youtube/DB/tracks.db`
- Updated jobs.html: Default limit 25→100 for better visibility
- Created and removed temporary scripts

## Impact Assessment
- **Workers**: No more CHECK constraint crashes
- **Zombie Cleanup**: Can now mark jobs as 'zombie' status
- **All JobStatus Values**: Supported in database
- **Data Integrity**: All 624 jobs preserved during migration
- **Operation Continuity**: System remains functional throughout

## Error Log Before Fix
```
Worker JobWorker-1 error: CHECK constraint failed: status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\eL\Dropbox\Programming\CursorProjects\Youtube\services\job_queue_service.py", line 159, in _worker_loop
    self._cleanup_zombie_jobs()
  File "C:\Users\eL\Dropbox\Programming\CursorProjects\Youtube\services\job_queue_service.py", line 444, in _cleanup_zombie_jobs
    cursor.execute("""

```

## Jobs Management UI Enhancement
- **Updated templates/jobs.html**: Changed default jobs display limit from 25 to 100
- **User Experience**: Better visibility of job queue status on `/jobs` page
- **Monitoring**: Easier to track the 44 incomplete download fix jobs now in queue

## Next Steps
- Monitor job queue for proper status transitions
- Watch for 44 incomplete download repair jobs completion
- No more CHECK constraint related worker crashes expected
