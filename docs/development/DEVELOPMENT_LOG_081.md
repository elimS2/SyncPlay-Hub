## Session: Job Queue CHECK Constraint Fix

### Log Entry #001 - 2025-06-29 08:38 UTC

**Files Modified:**
- `database/migrations/migration_003_add_missing_job_statuses.py` (created)

**Problem Fixed:**
Fixed critical CHECK constraint error in job_queue table that was causing worker failures:
```
Worker JobWorker-1 error: CHECK constraint failed: status IN ('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')
```

**Root Cause:**
The job_queue table CHECK constraint only allowed 5 statuses:
- `'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'`

But the job system code (JobStatus enum) used 9 statuses:
- `'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'` (allowed)
- `'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie'` (blocked by constraint)

When `_cleanup_zombie_jobs()` tried to mark jobs as 'zombie' status, the database rejected the operation.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Created `migration_003_add_missing_job_statuses.py` to update CHECK constraint
2. Updated constraint to allow all 9 statuses used by JobStatus enum
3. Applied migration successfully to database

**Technical Details:**
- SQLite doesn't support modifying CHECK constraints, so recreated table with new constraint
- Preserved all existing data during table recreation
- Recreated all indexes after table update
- Migration supports both up (apply) and down (rollback) operations

**Impact:**
- ✅ Zombie job cleanup now works without errors
- ✅ All JobStatus enum values can be stored in database
- ✅ Worker threads no longer crash on status updates
- ✅ System can properly handle timeout, retrying, dead_letter, and zombie statuses

**Testing:**
- Migration applied successfully
- Database schema updated correctly
- All existing job data preserved
- CHECK constraint now supports: `('pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled', 'timeout', 'retrying', 'dead_letter', 'zombie')`

This fix resolves the recurring worker errors and enables proper job lifecycle management with all intended statuses.
