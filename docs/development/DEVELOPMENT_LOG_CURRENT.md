```html
<button id="castBtn" class="ctrl-btn" title="Play on TV">
  <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor">
    <path d="M1 18v3h3c0-1.66-1.34-3-3-3zm0-4v2c2.76 0 5 2.24 5 5h2c0-3.87-3.13-7-7-7zm0-4v2c4.97 0 9 4.03 9 9h2c0-6.08-4.93-11-11-11zm20-7H3c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v3h2V5h18v14h-7v2h7c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2z"/>
  </svg>
</button>
```

**Favicon Implementation:**
```html
<link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 100 100'><text y='0.9em' font-size='90'>üéµ</text></svg>">
```

**Flask Favicon Route:**
```python
@app.route("/favicon.ico")
def favicon():
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static'), 'favicon.ico', mimetype='image/vnd.microsoft.icon')
```
