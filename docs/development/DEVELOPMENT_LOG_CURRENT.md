#### Technical Discovery:
**Critical Finding:** **Google Cast API behavior varies by URL:**
- ‚ùå `http://192.168.88.82:8000` - Cast API unavailable (`window.cast: false`)
- ‚úÖ `http://localhost:8000` - Cast API available (`window.cast: true`)
- ‚úÖ **Media URLs** must use IP addresses for Chromecast device access
- ‚úÖ **MP4 format** works reliably, `.webm` format causes black screen on some devices

#### Implementation Details:
**Cast Button HTML:**
```html
<button id="castBtn" class="ctrl-btn" title="Play on TV">
  <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor">
    <path d="M1 18v3h3c0-1.66-1.34-3-3-3zm0-4v2c2.76 0 5 2.24 5 5h2c0-3.87-3.13-7-7-7zm0-4v2c4.97 0 9 4.03 9 9h2c0-6.08-4.93-11-11-11zm20-7H3c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v3h2V5h18v14h-7v2h7c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2z"/>
  </svg>
</button>
```

**Favicon Implementation:**
```html
<link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 100 100'><text y='0.9em' font-size='90'>üéµ</text></svg>">
```

**Flask Favicon Route:**
```python
@app.route("/favicon.ico")
def favicon():
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static'), 'favicon.ico', mimetype='image/vnd.microsoft.icon')
```

### Log Entry #026 - 2025-06-21 14:10 UTC
### CRITICAL DATE CORRECTION - Mass Fix of January 2025 Phantom Dates

#### CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:
**MASSIVE DATE CONTAMINATION:** Found **hundreds** of incorrect dates "2025-01-21" throughout project files when actual date is "2025-06-21". This is a **5-month discrepancy** that makes NO physical sense!

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Impossible Dates:** How can project files contain January 2025 dates when project was created in June 2025?
- **Template Contamination:** Suggests widespread use of placeholder dates or faulty templates
- **Documentation Corruption:** Critical files contain fictional timelines
- **System Integrity:** Fundamental breach of temporal accuracy

#### Files with Phantom Dates Fixed:
1. **docs/README.md**
   - `development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#log-entry-001---2025-01-21` ‚Üí `development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_CURRENT.md#log-entry-024---2025-06-21-1407-utc`

2. **docs/development/PROJECT_HISTORY.md**
   - `Development Period: 2025-06-16 to 2025-01-21` ‚Üí `2025-06-16 to 2025-06-21`
   - `Current Status (2025-01-21)` ‚Üí `Current Status (2025-06-21)`
   - `Documentation Update...commits (2025-01-21)` ‚Üí `...(2025-06-21)`

3. **docs/development/CURSOR_RULES.md**
   - `Log Entry #002 - 2025-01-21 14:30` ‚Üí `2025-06-21 14:30`
   - `Phase 5: Bug Fixes & Improvements (2025-01-21)` ‚Üí `(2025-06-21)`
   - `Phase 5: Current Development (2025-01-21)` ‚Üí `(2025-06-21)`

#### STILL CONTAMINATED FILES (Need Future Cleanup):
- **PROJECT_HISTORY.md**: Multiple "Date: 2025-01-21" entries (53, 60, 145, 162, 169, 176, 183)
- **DEVELOPMENT_LOG_INDEX.md**: "2025-01-21" references in development period and timestamps
- **Various planning documents**: GIT_TIMESTAMP_CORRECTION_PLAN.md, LOG_SPLITTING_PLAN.md, TIMESTAMP_CORRECTION_SUMMARY.md
- **Backup files**: Correctly preserve historical phantom dates for reference

#### Root Cause Hypothesis:
1. **Template pollution** - Someone used "2025-01-21" as a placeholder date
2. **Copy-paste propagation** - Phantom date spread through documentation
3. **AI hallucination** - Previous AI assistants generated fictional dates
4. **Time zone confusion** - Some systematic date calculation error
