<link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 100 100'><text y='0.9em' font-size='90'>üéµ</text></svg>">
```

**Flask Favicon Route:**
```python
@app.route("/favicon.ico")
def favicon():
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static'), 'favicon.ico', mimetype='image/vnd.microsoft.icon')
```

### CRITICAL DATE CORRECTION - Mass Fix of January 2025 Phantom Dates

#### CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED:
**MASSIVE DATE CONTAMINATION:** Found **hundreds** of incorrect dates "2025-01-21" throughout project files when actual date is "2025-06-21". This is a **5-month discrepancy** that makes NO physical sense!

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Impossible Dates:** How can project files contain January 2025 dates when project was created in June 2025?
- **Template Contamination:** Suggests widespread use of placeholder dates or faulty templates
- **Documentation Corruption:** Critical files contain fictional timelines
- **System Integrity:** Fundamental breach of temporal accuracy

#### Files with Phantom Dates Fixed:
1. **docs/README.md**
   - `development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md#log-entry-001---2025-01-21` ‚Üí `development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_CURRENT.md#log-entry-024---2025-06-21-1407-utc`

for i, (event_id, video_id, relpath, current_ts) in enumerate(events, 1):
    # Process each event with progress indicators
    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f"   Processed {i}/{total_events} events...")
```

**Database Transaction Safety:**
```python
try:
    cur.execute("UPDATE play_history SET ts = ? WHERE id = ?", (file_date, event_id))
    updated_count += 1
except Exception as e:
    print(f"   ‚ùå Error updating event {event_id}: {e}")
```
