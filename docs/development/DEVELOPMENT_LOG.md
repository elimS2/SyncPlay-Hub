**Feature**: ✅ Added Missing "Removed" Event Type Filter + Database Analysis

**Issue Reported by User:**
- Missing filter option for "removed" event type on `/events` page  
- Discrepancy in counts: 49 tracks on `/deleted` vs 124 events on `/events?event_types=removed`

**Changes Made:**

**1. Added Missing Removed Filter to Events Page**
```html
<!-- Added to templates/history.html -->
<label class="event-type-checkbox" for="filter-removed">
  <input type="checkbox" id="filter-removed" {% if not filters.event_types_filter_applied or (filters.event_types and 'removed' in filters.event_types) %}checked{% endif %}>
  <span>Removed</span>
</label>
```

**2. Added Removed Event Type to Reference Guide**
```html
<div><span class="event-removed">🔴 removed</span> - Track deleted from library/playlist</div>
```

**Database Analysis Performed:**
- Investigated structure: `tracks.db` contains `deleted_tracks` table and `play_history` events
- Found event type "removed" is supported in code (`database.py:359`)
- Used in deletion workflows (`download_content.py`, `controllers/api/channels_api.py`)

**Key Findings:**

**Different Data Sources:**
- **Page `/deleted`**: Shows records from `deleted_tracks` table (physical deletions)
- **Page `/events?event_types=removed`**: Shows "removed" events from `play_history` (event log)

**Legitimate Reasons for Count Differences:**
1. **Multiple Deletions**: Same track deleted/restored/deleted again = multiple events, one deleted_tracks record
2. **Historical Events**: `play_history` keeps all events, `deleted_tracks` only current state
3. **Time Filtering**: `/deleted` page filters by last 30 days (default), `/events` shows all history
4. **Restored Tracks**: Events remain in history even after tracks are restored from trash

**User Experience Improvements:**
- ✅ **Complete Filter Set**: All event types now available for filtering
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Removed events styled with red color (🔴)
- ✅ **Proper Documentation**: Added to event types reference guide
- ✅ **Functional Parity**: Events page now covers all logged event types

**Technical Implementation:**
- **CSS Styling**: `.event-removed{color:#f44336;}` - red color for removed events
- **Template Logic**: Standard checkbox pattern with filter state preservation
- **JavaScript Integration**: Automatic inclusion in existing filter system
- **State Management**: Works with existing URL-based filtering and Toggle All functionality

**Impact:**
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Users can now filter and analyze track deletion patterns
- **Better Debugging**: Full access to deletion events helps identify sync issues
- **Data Completeness**: Events page now shows complete picture of all logged activities
- **User Understanding**: Clear explanation of count differences reduces confusion

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/history.html` - Added removed filter checkbox and reference entry

**Cleanup:**
- Created temporary analysis scripts: `analyze_removed_difference.py`, `check_db_path.py`
- These should be removed after issue resolution
