## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**NEVER ADD ENTRIES DIRECTLY TO THIS FILE!**

Instead:
1. **Create a separate file** `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_XXX.md` with the next number
2. **Update the list** in the "üóÇÔ∏è Log Entry Files" section above
3. **DO NOT EDIT** the main DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md file to add entries

**Correct process:**
  - ‚úÖ Create `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_117.md` for the next entry
- ‚úÖ Update the file list at the beginning of DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md  
- ‚ùå DO NOT add entries to the end of this file

**This is important for maintaining project structure and version control!**
