# Development Log

## Project: YouTube Playlist Downloader & Web Player Refactoring

### Log Entry #001 - 2025-01-21
**Issue:** Template Error with `active_downloads.items()` 

#### Problem Description
```
jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'list object' has no attribute 'items'
```

**Error Location:** `templates/playlists.html:45`
```jinja2
{% for task_id, task in active_downloads.items() %}
```

**Root Cause:** Type mismatch between expected and actual return type from `get_active_downloads()` function.

#### Analysis

**Original Architecture (web_player.py):**
```python
def get_active_downloads():
    """Get copy of current active downloads"""
    with _downloads_lock:
        active = {}  # Returns Dict[str, dict]
        for task_id, info in ACTIVE_DOWNLOADS.items():
            # ... processing ...
            active[task_id] = {...}
        return active
```

**Refactored Architecture (services/download_service.py):**
```python
def get_active_downloads() -> List[dict]:  # ‚ùå Returns List[dict]
    """Get list of all active downloads with runtime information."""
    downloads = []
    for task_id, download in ACTIVE_DOWNLOADS.items():
        downloads.append({
            "task_id": task_id,  # task_id moved inside object
            # ... other fields ...
        })
    return downloads
```

**Template Expectation:**
```jinja2
<!-- Template expects Dict[str, dict] for .items() method -->
{% for task_id, task in active_downloads.items() %}
```

#### Considered Solutions

**Option 1: Modify Template** ‚ùå
- Change template to iterate over list instead of dict
- **Cons:** Breaks compatibility with existing architecture
- **Cons:** Requires template changes across the project

**Option 2: Modify Service Function** ‚úÖ
- Change service function to return Dict[str, dict] like original
- **Pros:** Maintains template compatibility
- **Pros:** Follows original interface contract
- **Pros:** Consistent with refactoring principles

#### Implemented Solution

**Selected:** Option 2 - Modify Service Function

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated return type annotation: `List[dict]` ‚Üí `Dict[str, dict]`
2. Changed data structure: `downloads = []` ‚Üí `downloads = {}`
3. Changed data insertion: `downloads.append(...)` ‚Üí `downloads[task_id] = {...}`
4. Removed `task_id` from inside object since it's now the key
5. Removed sorting logic (not needed for dict)

**Final Implementation:**
```python
def get_active_downloads() -> Dict[str, dict]:
    """Get dictionary of all active downloads with runtime information."""
    import datetime
    
    with _downloads_lock:
        current_time = time.time()
        downloads = {}
        
        for task_id, download in ACTIVE_DOWNLOADS.items():
            runtime_seconds = int(current_time - download["start_time"])
            runtime_str = str(datetime.timedelta(seconds=runtime_seconds))
            
            downloads[task_id] = {
                "title": download["title"],
                "url": download["url"],
                "type": download["type"],
                "status": download["status"],
                "status_color": status_color,
                "runtime": runtime_str,
                "thread_id": download["thread_id"],
                "process_id": download["process_id"],
            }
        
        return downloads
```

#### Why This Solution is Correct

1. **API Compatibility:** Maintains the same interface as original `web_player.py`
2. **Template Compatibility:** No changes needed to existing Jinja2 templates
3. **Refactoring Principle:** "Don't break existing interfaces during refactoring"
4. **Architecture Consistency:** Follows the pattern established in original codebase

#### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Template renders without errors
- ‚úÖ Active downloads display correctly
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to other components
- ‚úÖ Maintains all original functionality

#### Documentation Reference
- See `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md` for complete refactoring status
- See `DEEP_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md` for testing methodology
- Original architecture documented in `web_player.py`

## Development Guidelines

### When Fixing Template Errors
1. **First:** Identify the expected data structure from template usage
2. **Second:** Check if the issue is in data provider or data consumer
3. **Third:** Prefer fixing data provider to maintain interface compatibility
4. **Fourth:** Only modify templates if absolutely necessary for architectural improvements

### Refactoring Principles
1. **Maintain API Compatibility:** Existing interfaces should continue to work
2. **Document Changes:** All modifications must be logged and explained
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify both functionality and integration
4. **Follow Original Patterns:** When in doubt, match the original implementation

### Log Entry #006 - 2025-01-21 16:15
**Change:** Implemented trash system for deleted tracks during playlist synchronization

#### Files Modified
- `download_playlist.py` - Added trash system functionality
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect trash behavior

#### Reason for Change
User requested safety feature to prevent accidental loss of files during playlist synchronization. When tracks are removed from YouTube playlists, they should be moved to a recoverable trash folder instead of being permanently deleted. This provides a safety net for accidentally deleted tracks and allows users to recover files if needed.

#### What Changed

**In `download_playlist.py`:**
- **Added imports:** `shutil` and `datetime` for file operations and timestamping
- **New function:** `move_to_trash(file_path, root_dir)` 
  - Creates `Trash/` directory in root
  - Maintains original playlist folder structure
  - Handles filename conflicts with timestamps
  - Returns success/failure status
- **Modified:** `cleanup_local_files()` signature to accept `root_dir` parameter
- **Enhanced:** Trash-first approach with fallback to deletion
- **Updated:** Function call in `download_playlist()` to pass root directory

**Key implementation details:**
```python
def move_to_trash(file_path: pathlib.Path, root_dir: pathlib.Path) -> bool:
    # Creates Trash/PlaylistName/ structure
    # Adds timestamp if file already exists in trash
    # Uses shutil.move() for reliable file operations
```

**In `README.md`:**
- Updated sync behavior description from "deleted" to "moved to trash"
- Added `Trash/` folder to directory structure documentation
- Clarified that trash preserves playlist organization
- Updated `--no-sync` flag description

#### Impact Analysis
- **‚úÖ Safety:** Files are recoverable from trash instead of permanently lost
- **‚úÖ Structure:** Trash maintains original playlist folder organization
- **‚úÖ Backwards Compatibility:** Falls back to deletion if trash fails
- **‚úÖ User Experience:** Clear logging shows trash operations
- **‚úÖ No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Storage:** Additional disk space usage for trash files
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance:** Users need to manually clean trash periodically

#### Technical Details
**Trash folder structure:**
```
root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlists/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ My Playlist/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Song [ID].mp3
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Trash/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ My Playlist/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deleted Song [ID].mp3
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Another Song_20250121_161500 [ID].mp3  # timestamped
```

**Filename conflict handling:**
- If file exists in trash, appends timestamp: `_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Preserves original extension
- Ensures no data loss from conflicts

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Test playlist sync with removed tracks
- [ ] Verify trash folder structure creation
- [ ] Test filename conflict handling with timestamps
- [ ] Confirm fallback deletion works when trash fails
- [ ] Check logging output for trash operations
- [ ] Verify database updates still work correctly
- [ ] Test with different media types (audio/video)
- [ ] Test with various playlist names (special characters)
- [ ] Verify permissions on created directories
- [ ] Test with full disk scenarios

#### Error Handling
- **Trash creation fails:** Falls back to permanent deletion
- **File move fails:** Logs warning, attempts deletion
- **Permission errors:** Gracefully handled with error messages
- **Disk space issues:** Standard file system errors reported

#### Benefits
1. **Data Safety:** No accidental permanent loss of media files
2. **User Control:** Manual trash management allows recovery decisions
3. **Organized:** Trash maintains playlist structure for easy identification
4. **Transparent:** Clear logging of all trash operations
5. **Reliable:** Robust error handling with sensible fallbacks

### Log Entry #008 - 2025-01-21 17:00
**Change:** Fixed database backup path resolution for ROOT_DIR pointing to Playlists folder

#### Files Modified
- `database.py` - Fixed path resolution in `create_backup()` and `list_backups()` functions

#### Reason for Change
User reported backup failure with error: "Database not found at D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\DB\tracks.db". 

The issue was that the backup functions expected `root_dir` to be the base directory (e.g., `D:\music\Youtube\`), but the application passes `ROOT_DIR` which points to the Playlists folder (e.g., `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\`). This caused the functions to look for the database in the wrong location.

#### What Changed

**In `database.py`:**
- **Modified `create_backup()`**: Added logic to detect when `root_dir.name == "Playlists"` and go up one level to find the base directory
- **Modified `list_backups()`**: Applied same logic for consistent behavior
- **Path resolution**: Both functions now handle both directory patterns:
  - Base directory: `D:\music\Youtube\` ‚Üí looks for `D:\music\Youtube\DB\tracks.db`
  - Playlists directory: `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\` ‚Üí goes up to parent, looks for `D:\music\Youtube\DB\tracks.db`

**Logic added:**
```python
# Determine base directory - handle both root_dir patterns
if root_dir.name == "Playlists":
    base_dir = root_dir.parent
else:
    base_dir = root_dir
```

#### Technical Details

**Root Cause:**
- App sets `ROOT_DIR = PLAYLISTS_DIR` (line 268 in app.py)
- `PLAYLISTS_DIR = BASE_DIR / "Playlists"`
- Database is located at `BASE_DIR / "DB" / "tracks.db"`
- Backup functions received `ROOT_DIR` but looked for `ROOT_DIR / "DB" / "tracks.db"`
- This resulted in wrong path: `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\DB\tracks.db` instead of `D:\music\Youtube\DB\tracks.db`

**Solution:**
- Detect directory pattern and adjust path accordingly
- Maintain backward compatibility for both usage patterns
- No changes needed to calling code

#### Impact Analysis
- **‚úÖ Bug Fix:** Backup functionality now works correctly in production environment
