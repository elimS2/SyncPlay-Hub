## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI ASSISTANTS

**NEVER ADD ENTRIES DIRECTLY TO THIS FILE!**

Instead:
1. **Create a separate file** `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_XXX.md` with the next number
2. **Update the list** in the "üóÇÔ∏è Log Entry Files" section above
3. **DO NOT EDIT** the main DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md file to add entries

**Correct process:**
  - ‚úÖ Create `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_121.md` for the next entry
- ‚úÖ Update the file list at the beginning of DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md  
- ‚ùå DO NOT add entries to the end of this file

**This is important for maintaining project structure and version control!**

### Log Entry #125 - 2025-07-05 01:35 UTC

**Fixed API Error in Jobs Queue Status Endpoint**

**Issue:** 
- User reported error "'status'" on jobs page (http://192.168.88.82:8000/jobs)
- API endpoint `/api/jobs/queue/status` was returning malformed JSON response
- JavaScript loadQueueStatus() function was failing with KeyError

**Root Cause:**
- Method `get_queue_stats()` in `JobQueueService` was accessing uninitialized fields from `self._stats`
- Fields `total_jobs`, `completed_jobs`, `failed_jobs` were always 0 and never updated
- No error handling for database access failures

**Solution:**
- Updated `get_queue_stats()` method to calculate statistics directly from database
- Added proper error handling with try-catch block
- Added `total_jobs` calculation from database query
- Extract status counts directly from database results instead of using `self._stats`
- Return fallback statistics in case of database errors

**Files Modified:**
- `services/job_queue_service.py` - Enhanced `get_queue_stats()` method

**Impact:**
- Jobs page now loads correctly without "'status'" error
- API endpoint returns proper JSON with real statistics from database
- Improved error resilience for queue status requests
- Better user experience on jobs management page

**Testing:**
- API endpoint tested via curl: returns proper JSON response
- Error "'status'" resolved
- All queue statistics now calculated from actual database data

- Added `updatePaginationControls()` function to manage button states and pagination info display
- Updated filter event listeners to reset pagination when filters change
- Added Enter key support for page jump input field

**Technical Details:**
- Pagination shows/hides automatically based on whether multiple pages exist
- Uses existing API `/api/jobs` with `limit` and `offset` parameters
- Default page size is 50 jobs per page (configurable via limit filter)
- Pagination info shows current page, total pages, and total jobs count
- Jump-to-page functionality with input validation

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/jobs.html` - Added pagination UI, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic

**Impact:**
- Improves performance when dealing with large number of jobs

### Log Entry #118 - 2025-07-05 02:20 UTC

**Summary:** Added environment settings display to settings page
**Impact:** Enhanced settings page to show .env file configuration variables

**Changes Made:**
1. **app.py Modifications:**
   - Modified `settings_page()` function to load and pass env_config to template
   - Added `env_config = _load_env_config()` to load environment variables
   - Updated all render_template calls to include env_config parameter

2. **templates/settings.html Modifications:**

   - Displays current .env file settings if available
   - Shows available environment variables with descriptions
   - Provides example .env file configuration
   - Added helpful documentation for users

**Technical Details:**
- Leveraged existing `_load_env_config()` function in app.py
- Added conditional display based on env_config presence
- Maintains backward compatibility when no .env file exists
- Provides clear instructions for .env file creation

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Enhanced settings_page function
- `templates/settings.html` - Added environment configuration section

**Testing Needed:**
- Verify settings page displays correctly with and without .env file
- Test .env file loading and display functionality

### Log Entry #124 - 2025-07-05 09:57 UTC

**Summary**: Fixed job queue statistics displaying zeros in web interface

**Problem**: 
- Job queue statistics on /jobs page showed all zeros (0 total jobs, 0 running, 0 completed, etc.)
- Despite having 4838 total jobs in database with 2196 pending jobs
- User reported Single Video Metadata Extraction jobs were processing but not reflected in statistics

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- API endpoints were creating new JobQueueService instances with `max_workers=1` parameter
- These new instances had no registered workers (0 registered workers)
- While database contained tasks, service couldn't process them due to missing workers
- Main application used different service instance with proper worker registration

**Solution**:
1. **Fixed API Service Calls**: Removed `max_workers=1` parameter from all API endpoint calls
   - `controllers/api/jobs_api.py`: 8 instances fixed
   - `controllers/api/backup_api.py`: 3 instances fixed  
   - `controllers/api/channels_api.py`: 1 instance fixed
2. **Ensured Singleton Pattern**: All API endpoints now use same service instance as main application
3. **Verified Worker Registration**: Main application registers workers, API reuses same instance

**Files Modified**:
- `controllers/api/jobs_api.py`: Fixed all `get_job_queue_service(max_workers=1)` calls
- `controllers/api/backup_api.py`: Fixed all `get_job_queue_service(max_workers=1)` calls
- `controllers/api/channels_api.py`: Fixed `get_job_queue_service(max_workers=1)` call

**Testing**:
- Created diagnostic scripts to verify service state
- Confirmed main application has registered workers
- Verified API calls now use same service instance
- Deleted temporary debug files

**Expected Result**: 
- Job queue statistics should now display correct values
- Queue status panel should show actual job counts
- Running jobs should be properly tracked and displayed

**Next Steps**:
- Test web interface to confirm statistics display correctly
- Monitor job processing to ensure no disruption
- Verify all job management features work properly

### Log Entry #124b - 2025-07-05 10:09 UTC

**Summary**: Fixed job queue service default parameters to ensure consistent behavior

**Additional Issue Found**: 
- After testing, API still returned zeros due to service creation order
- API blueprint imported before main service initialization
- First call to `get_job_queue_service()` used default `max_workers=3` parameter
- Created new service instance instead of using configured one

**Root Cause**: 
- Default parameter `max_workers=3` in singleton function
- API calls during import phase created service with wrong parameters
- Main application `max_workers=1` parameter ignored for existing singleton

**Solution**:
- Changed default parameter in `get_job_queue_service()` from `max_workers=3` to `max_workers=1`
- Changed default parameter in `JobQueueService.__init__()` for consistency
- Ensures all service instances use sequential processing regardless of call order

**Files Modified**:
- `services/job_queue_service.py`: Updated default parameters to max_workers=1

**Testing**:
- Verified new default creates service with max_workers=1
- Removed temporary debug code and test files

**Result**: 
Now any call to `get_job_queue_service()` will create service with max_workers=1, 
ensuring sequential job processing and preventing thousands of tasks from running simultaneously.
