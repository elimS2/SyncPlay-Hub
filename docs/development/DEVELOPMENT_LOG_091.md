## 🎯 Task: Fix Incorrect Menu Link in Deleted Page

### 📋 Problem Description
User reported that on the page `http://192.168.88.82:8000/deleted` there was an incorrect link to `http://192.168.88.82:8000/playlists` in the menu.

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Templates inconsistency**: In `deleted.html`, the "Playlists" menu link was pointing to `/playlists`
2. **Missing route**: The Flask app had no route for `/playlists` - only `/` (homepage) which shows playlists
3. **Navigation mismatch**: Other templates (channels.html, likes_playlists.html) also used `/playlists` link but it was broken

### ✅ Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Missing Route
**File**: `app.py`
```python
# Before
@app.route("/")
def playlists_page():

# After  
@app.route("/")
@app.route("/playlists")
def playlists_page():
```

#### 2. Verified Menu Links
**File**: `templates/deleted.html`
- Confirmed "Playlists" link points to `/playlists` (now working)
- Confirmed "Home" link points to `/` (working)
- Both routes now lead to the same playlists page

### 🧪 Testing Results
- **Before**: `/playlists` link returned 404 error
- **After**: Both `/` and `/playlists` work correctly and show the same playlists page
- **Menu consistency**: All templates now have working navigation links

### 📁 Files Modified
1. `app.py` - Added `/playlists` route decorator
2. `templates/deleted.html` - Verified correct menu link structure

### 💡 Impact Analysis
- **Positive**: Fixed broken navigation in all pages with "Playlists" menu link
- **User Experience**: Consistent navigation behavior across all pages
- **Maintenance**: Both routes point to same function, easy to maintain
