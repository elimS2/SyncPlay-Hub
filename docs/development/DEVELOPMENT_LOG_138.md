## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Player State Structure
- Added `player_type` field to track 'regular' or 'virtual'
- Added `player_source` field to track current player URL path
- Both fields added to global `PLAYER_STATE` dictionary

### 2. Player Type Identification
- Regular player (`player.js`) sends `player_type: 'regular'`
- Virtual player (`player-virtual.js`) sends `player_type: 'virtual'`
- Both send `player_source: window.location.pathname` for URL tracking

### 3. Remote API Improvements
- Enhanced `api_remote_sync_internal()` to track player type
- Added logging to show which player type is syncing
- Improved state management for different player types

### 4. Remote Control UI Enhancement
- Added player type indicator showing current active player
- Visual distinction between regular (üìÅ) and virtual (‚ù§Ô∏è) playlists
- Shows player source URL for debugging
- Auto-hides when no player type is available

## Testing
- Remote control now correctly identifies active player type
- Commands are sent to the correct player regardless of type
- UI shows clear indication of which player is active
- No more state conflicts between different player types

## Impact

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```javascript
// Both players sent identical sync data
const playerState = {
  current_track: currentTrack,
  playing: !media.paused,
  volume: media.volume,
  // No player identification
};
```

### After Fix
```javascript
// Regular player
const playerState = {
  current_track: currentTrack,
  playing: !media.paused,
  volume: media.volume,
  player_type: 'regular',
  player_source: window.location.pathname
};

// Virtual player
const playerState = {
  current_track: currentTrack,
  playing: !media.paused,
  volume: media.volume,
  player_type: 'virtual',
  player_source: window.location.pathname
};
```

### Server-side Enhancement
```python
@remote_bp.route("/remote/sync_internal", methods=["POST"])
def api_remote_sync_internal():
    global PLAYER_STATE
    data = request.get_json() or {}
    
    # Get player type from request
    player_type = data.get('player_type', 'regular')
    player_source = data.get('player_source', 'unknown')
    
    # Update server state with player data
    PLAYER_STATE.update(data)
    PLAYER_STATE['player_type'] = player_type
    PLAYER_STATE['player_source'] = player_source
    
    log_message(f"[Remote] State synced from {player_type} player ({player_source})")
    
    return jsonify({"status": "ok"})
```

## User Experience
- Remote control page now shows which player is active
- Clear visual indication of player type (üìÅ for regular, ‚ù§Ô∏è for virtual)
- No more confusion about which player is being controlled
- Commands work reliably regardless of player type

## Future Enhancements
- Could add player switching functionality
- Could implement multi-player control
- Could add player status history
- Could implement player discovery mechanism
