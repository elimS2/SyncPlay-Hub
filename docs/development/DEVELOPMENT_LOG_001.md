## Project: YouTube Playlist Downloader & Web Player Refactoring

### Log Entry #001 - 2025-06-19 21:53:34 +0300 (Git: 7231027)
**Issue:** Template Error with `active_downloads.items()`
**Commit:** `7231027` - Add stop server functionality 

#### Problem Description
```
jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'list object' has no attribute 'items'
```

**Error Location:** `templates/playlists.html:45`
```jinja2
{% for task_id, task in active_downloads.items() %}
```

**Root Cause:** Type mismatch between expected and actual return type from `get_active_downloads()` function.

#### Implemented Solution
**Selected:** Modify Service Function to return `Dict[str, dict]` instead of `List[dict]`

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated return type annotation: `List[dict]` ‚Üí `Dict[str, dict]`
2. Changed data structure: `downloads = []` ‚Üí `downloads = {}`  
3. Changed data insertion: `downloads.append(...)` ‚Üí `downloads[task_id] = {...}`
4. Removed `task_id` from inside object since it's now the key

#### Why This Solution is Correct
1. **API Compatibility:** Maintains the same interface as original `web_player.py`
2. **Template Compatibility:** No changes needed to existing Jinja2 templates
3. **Refactoring Principle:** "Don't break existing interfaces during refactoring"

### Log Entry #004 - 2025-06-19 23:18:37 +0300 (Git: 8828342)
**Change:** Enhanced PROJECT_HISTORY.md with complete git timeline (63 commits)
**Commit:** `8828342` - Add ANSI code cleaning and Flask logger configuration

#### Files Modified
- `docs/development/PROJECT_HISTORY.md` - Added comprehensive git history analysis

#### Reason for Change
Initial PROJECT_HISTORY.md focused only on architectural refactoring but missed the complete development story. With **63 commits** spanning 4 days (2025-06-16 to 2025-06-20), there was much more history to document.

#### What Changed
**Added complete development timeline:**
- **Project Statistics:** 63 commits, 4-day intensive development period
- **Phase 0: Project Genesis** - Initial import and basic functionality
- **Phase 1: UI/UX Development** - Player controls and user experience
- **Phase 2: Download System** - Progress tracking and authentication
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - Database and streaming capabilities

*End of Log Entry #004*

### Log Entry #005 - 2025-06-21 03:13:46 +0300 (Git: 82d09a5)
**Change:** Added mandatory git history synchronization rules
**Commit:** `82d09a5` - Refactor legacy code organization

#### Files Modified
- `.cursorrules` - Added Git History Synchronization section
- `docs/development/CURSOR_RULES.md` - Added comprehensive git sync guidelines

#### Reason for Change
Need to ensure that all git commits are properly documented in PROJECT_HISTORY.md to maintain complete project context. With 63+ commits already in the project, it's critical that any new commits are immediately reflected in the documentation.

#### What Changed
**Key workflow additions:**
1. **Check current HEAD:** `git log -1 --oneline`
2. **Verify in PROJECT_HISTORY.md:** Find commit in timeline
3. **If missing:** Add to appropriate phase
4. **Update statistics:** Total commits count

*End of Log Entry #005*

### Log Entry #006 - 2025-06-21 02:42:12 +0300 (Git: 2d1242c)
**Change:** Implemented trash system for deleted tracks during playlist synchronization
**Commit:** `2d1242c` - Implement trash management for removed files

#### Files Modified
- `download_playlist.py` - Added trash system functionality
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect trash behavior

#### Reason for Change
User requested safety feature to prevent accidental loss of files during playlist synchronization. When tracks are removed from YouTube playlists, they should be moved to a recoverable trash folder instead of being permanently deleted.

#### What Changed
**In `download_playlist.py`:**
- **New function:** `move_to_trash(file_path, root_dir)` 
- Creates `Trash/` directory in root
- Maintains original playlist folder structure
- Handles filename conflicts with timestamps

**Trash folder structure:**
```
root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Playlists/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ My Playlist/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Song [ID].mp3
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Trash/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ My Playlist/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deleted Song [ID].mp3
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Another Song_20250121_161500 [ID].mp3  # timestamped
```

### Log Entry #007 - 2025-06-21 03:03:58 +0300 (Git: ec7726b)
**Change:** Implemented comprehensive database backup system with web interface
**Commit:** `ec7726b` - Implement comprehensive database backup system

#### Files Modified
- `database.py` - Added backup creation and listing functions
- `controllers/api_controller.py` - Added backup API endpoints
- `templates/playlists.html` - Added backup button to main page
- `templates/backups.html` - New backup management page
- `app.py` - Added backup page route

#### Reason for Change
User requested database backup functionality to protect valuable music library data. The system needed to create timestamped backups on demand and provide web interface for backup management.

#### Technical Implementation
**Backup Creation Process:**
1. Creates `Backups/DB/` directory structure
2. Generates UTC timestamp folder name
3. Uses SQLite's `.backup()` API for consistency
4. Records backup event in play history

**Backup Storage Structure:**
```
root/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backups/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DB/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250121_143000_UTC/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tracks.db
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250121_150000_UTC/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tracks.db
```

### Log Entry #008 - 2025-06-19 23:45:31 +0300 (Git: 9f0196f)
**Change:** Fixed database backup path resolution for ROOT_DIR pointing to Playlists folder
**Commit:** `9f0196f` - Enhance README.md

#### Files Modified
- `database.py` - Fixed path resolution in `create_backup()` and `list_backups()` functions

#### Reason for Change
User reported backup failure with error: "Database not found at D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\DB\tracks.db". 

The issue was that the backup functions expected `root_dir` to be the base directory, but the application passes `ROOT_DIR` which points to the Playlists folder.

#### What Changed
**Logic added:**
```python
# Determine base directory - handle both root_dir patterns
if root_dir.name == "Playlists":
    base_dir = root_dir.parent
else:
    base_dir = root_dir
```

**Root Cause:**
- App sets `ROOT_DIR = PLAYLISTS_DIR`
- Database is located at `BASE_DIR / "DB" / "tracks.db"`
- Backup functions received `ROOT_DIR` but looked for `ROOT_DIR / "DB" / "tracks.db"`

*End of Log Entry #008*
