# Development Log Entry #123

## üìã Entry Information

**Entry ID:** 123  
**Date:** 2025-07-05 09:45 UTC  
**Type:** Code Quality - Language Policy Compliance  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Completed  

**Related Files:**
- `services/job_queue_service.py` - Fixed all Russian comments and docstrings to English

## üåê Issue Description

**Problem:** 
User identified Russian language comments and docstrings in the codebase, which violates the project's mandatory English-only code language policy. According to project rules, all source code including comments, docstrings, and variable names must be written exclusively in English.

**Root Cause:**
Russian comments and docstrings were left in the code during development, violating the language policy.

## üîß Solution Implementation

### Changes Made

**1. Fixed All Russian Comments:**
- Replaced all Cyrillic docstrings with English equivalents
- Updated inline comments from Russian to English
- Maintained same meaning and clarity in translations

**2. Examples of Translations:**
- `"""–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–æ–π —Å–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Å —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥—å—é –∑–∞–¥–∞—á."""` ‚Üí `"""Main job queue management service."""`
- `# –°–æ–∑–¥–∞–µ–º –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç Job` ‚Üí `# Create Job object`
- `# –û–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è–µ–º —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å –≤ –±–∞–∑–µ` ‚Üí `# Update status in database`
- `"""–ü–æ–ª—É—á–∞–µ—Ç —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á —Å —Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–µ–π."""` ‚Üí `"""Get list of jobs with filtering."""`

**3. Comprehensive Coverage:**
- Fixed 30+ Russian comments/docstrings
- Ensured all method documentation is in English
- Verified no Cyrillic characters remain in the file

## ‚úÖ Verification

**Testing:**
- Used `grep_search` with Cyrillic pattern `[–∞-—è—ë–ê-–Ø–Å]` to verify complete removal
- Confirmed "No matches found" after fixes
- All functionality remains intact

**Code Quality:**
- Maintained original code structure and logic
- Preserved comment placement and formatting
- Enhanced international accessibility of codebase

## üìù Notes

This fix ensures compliance with the project's mandatory English-only code policy:
- All source code must be written exclusively in English
- Includes variables, functions, classes, comments, documentation, strings
- No exceptions allowed regardless of developer communication language
- Improves codebase accessibility for international developers

## üîÑ Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Full compliance with project language policy
- ‚úÖ Improved international code accessibility
- ‚úÖ Enhanced maintainability for global team
- ‚úÖ Consistent code documentation standards

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Logic and functionality remain unchanged
- All method signatures preserved
- Performance characteristics unaffected

## üì¶ Related Components
