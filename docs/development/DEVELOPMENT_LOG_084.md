## Feature Implementation - Virtual Playlists by Likes
**Request**: Implement virtual playlists that group tracks by their like count, with smart shuffle functionality.

**Feature Description**: 
Created a virtual playlist system that dynamically groups tracks based on the number of likes (❤️ button presses), allowing users to play all tracks with 1 like, 2 likes, 3 likes, etc., each with intelligent shuffle prioritizing tracks that haven't been played for a long time.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **Virtual Playlists**: Non-persistent playlists based on like count grouping
- **Smart Shuffle**: Uses existing `smartShuffle()` algorithm for priority-based randomization
- **Dynamic Statistics**: Real-time analysis of track distribution by likes
- **Seamless Integration**: Leverages existing player infrastructure

### Architecture Overview
```
Database (tracks.play_likes) → API Endpoints → Virtual Playlist UI → Enhanced Player
```

### Files Created/Modified

#### New API Endpoints (`controllers/api/playlist_api.py`)
```python
@playlist_bp.route("/tracks_by_likes/<int:like_count>", methods=["GET"])
def api_tracks_by_likes(like_count):
    """Get all tracks that have exactly the specified number of likes."""

@playlist_bp.route("/like_stats", methods=["GET"])  
def api_like_stats():
    """Get statistics about tracks grouped by like count."""
```

#### New Routes (`app.py`)
```python
@app.route("/likes")
def likes_playlists_page():
    """Virtual playlists by likes page."""
    
@app.route("/likes_player/<int:like_count>")
def likes_player_page(like_count: int):
    """Player page for virtual playlist by like count."""
```

#### New Templates
- `templates/likes_playlists.html` - Virtual playlists overview page
- `templates/likes_player.html` - Enhanced player for virtual playlists

#### Enhanced Navigation
- Added "❤️ Likes Playlists" button to main playlists page
- Integrated with existing sidebar navigation

## Feature Specifications

### Virtual Playlist Interface
- **Grid Layout**: Card-based display showing each like count as separate playlist
- **Statistics Display**: Track count and sample tracks for each like category
- **Interactive Cards**: Clickable cards navigate to dedicated player
- **Empty State Handling**: User-friendly messaging when no liked tracks exist

### Enhanced Player Features
- **Like Count Header**: Clear indication of current virtual playlist (e.g., "❤️ 3 likes")
- **Track Counter**: Dynamic display of total tracks in current like category  
- **Smart Shuffle Integration**: Automatic application of existing intelligent randomization
- **All Standard Controls**: Full feature parity with regular playlists (play, skip, delete, etc.)

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "tracks": [...],
  "like_count": 3,
  "total_tracks": 42
}
```

## Technical Details

### Database Integration
- Leverages existing `tracks.play_likes` column
- No schema changes required
- Efficient SQL queries with GROUP BY operations
- Real-time statistics calculation

### Smart Shuffle Algorithm
Uses existing `smartShuffle()` function from `static/player.js`:
- **Group 1**: Never played tracks (highest priority)
- **Group 2**: Tracks not played this year
- **Group 3**: Tracks not played this month  
- **Group 4**: Tracks not played this week
- **Group 5**: Tracks not played today
- **Group 6**: Recently played tracks (lowest priority)

### Player.js Integration
- **fetchTracks() Override**: Custom API calls for virtual playlists
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Full compatibility with current player features
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Loading States**: User feedback during data fetching

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Intuitive Discovery**: Easy access to favorite tracks by preference level
- ✅ **Smart Playback**: Intelligent ordering prevents recently played repetition  
- ✅ **Visual Organization**: Clear categorization by like intensity
- ✅ **Seamless Navigation**: Consistent interface with existing playlists

### Technical Benefits
- ✅ **Zero Data Migration**: Uses existing like tracking system
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ✅ **Code Reuse**: Leverages existing player, shuffle, and API infrastructure
- ✅ **Scalable Design**: Supports unlimited like categories dynamically

### Workflow Enhancement
- **Preference-Based Discovery**: Quickly access tracks by enjoyment level
- **Rediscovery Assistance**: Smart shuffle surfaces forgotten favorites
- **Listening Variety**: Prevents repetitive playback patterns
- **Rating System**: Like counts serve as implicit rating mechanism

## Files Modified
- `controllers/api/playlist_api.py` (added virtual playlist API endpoints)
- `app.py` (added virtual playlist routes)
- `templates/likes_playlists.html` (new virtual playlist overview page)
- `templates/likes_player.html` (new enhanced player for virtual playlists)
- `templates/playlists.html` (added navigation button)
- `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_084.md` (this documentation)

## Code Quality Compliance
- ✅ **English Language**: All code, comments, strings, and UI text in English
- ✅ **API Standards**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized database queries and efficient rendering

## Testing Checklist
- ⏳ Verify like statistics API returns correct track counts
- ⏳ Test virtual playlist player with various like counts
- ⏳ Confirm smart shuffle works with virtual playlists
- ⏳ Validate empty state handling (no tracks with specific like count)
- ⏳ Test navigation between virtual playlists and regular playlists
- ⏳ Verify all player controls work in virtual playlist mode

## Future Enhancements
- **Filtering Options**: Date ranges, genres, or playlist source filters
- **Bulk Actions**: Multi-select operations across virtual playlists
- **Export Functionality**: Convert virtual playlists to regular playlists
- **Advanced Statistics**: Play frequency vs. like correlation analysis

## Risk Assessment: LOW
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Uses established database schema and API patterns
- Fallback gracefully when no liked tracks exist
- Virtual nature means no data persistence concerns
- Compatible with all existing player features
