## Feature Implementation - Virtual Playlists by Likes
**Request**: Implement virtual playlists that group tracks by their like count, with smart shuffle functionality.

**Feature Description**: 
Created a virtual playlist system that dynamically groups tracks based on the number of likes (‚ù§Ô∏è button presses), allowing users to play all tracks with 1 like, 2 likes, 3 likes, etc., each with intelligent shuffle prioritizing tracks that haven't been played for a long time.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **Virtual Playlists**: Non-persistent playlists based on like count grouping
- **Smart Shuffle**: Uses existing `smartShuffle()` algorithm for priority-based randomization
- **Dynamic Statistics**: Real-time analysis of track distribution by likes
- **Seamless Integration**: Leverages existing player infrastructure

### Architecture Overview
```
Database (tracks.play_likes) ‚Üí API Endpoints ‚Üí Virtual Playlist UI ‚Üí Enhanced Player
```

### Files Created/Modified

#### New API Endpoints (`controllers/api/playlist_api.py`)
```python
@playlist_bp.route("/tracks_by_likes/<int:like_count>", methods=["GET"])
def api_tracks_by_likes(like_count):
    """Get all tracks that have exactly the specified number of likes."""

@playlist_bp.route("/like_stats", methods=["GET"])  
def api_like_stats():
    """Get statistics about tracks grouped by like count."""
```

#### New Routes (`app.py`)
```python
@app.route("/likes")
def likes_playlists_page():
    """Virtual playlists by likes page."""
    
@app.route("/likes_player/<int:like_count>")
def likes_player_page(like_count: int):
    """Player page for virtual playlist by like count."""
```

#### New Templates
- `templates/likes_playlists.html` - Virtual playlists overview page
- `templates/likes_player.html` - Enhanced player for virtual playlists

#### Enhanced Navigation
- Added "‚ù§Ô∏è Likes Playlists" button to main playlists page
- Integrated with existing sidebar navigation

## Feature Specifications

### Virtual Playlist Interface
- **Grid Layout**: Card-based display showing each like count as separate playlist
- **Statistics Display**: Track count and sample tracks for each like category
- **Interactive Cards**: Clickable cards navigate to dedicated player
- **Empty State Handling**: User-friendly messaging when no liked tracks exist

### Enhanced Player Features
- **Like Count Header**: Clear indication of current virtual playlist (e.g., "‚ù§Ô∏è 3 likes")
- **Track Counter**: Dynamic display of total tracks in current like category  
- **Smart Shuffle Integration**: Automatic application of existing intelligent randomization
- **All Standard Controls**: Full feature parity with regular playlists (play, skip, delete, etc.)

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "tracks": [...],
  "like_count": 3,
  "total_tracks": 42
}
```

## Technical Details

### Database Integration
- Leverages existing `tracks.play_likes` column
- No schema changes required
- Efficient SQL queries with GROUP BY operations
- Real-time statistics calculation

### Smart Shuffle Algorithm
Uses existing `smartShuffle()` function from `static/player.js`:
- **Group 1**: Never played tracks (highest priority)
- **Group 2**: Tracks not played this year
- **Group 3**: Tracks not played this month  
- **Group 4**: Tracks not played this week
- **Group 5**: Tracks not played today
- **Group 6**: Recently played tracks (lowest priority)

### Player.js Integration
- **fetchTracks() Override**: Custom API calls for virtual playlists
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Full compatibility with current player features
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Loading States**: User feedback during data fetching

## Impact Assessment

## Files Modified
- `controllers/api/playlist_api.py` (added virtual playlist API endpoints)
- `app.py` (added virtual playlist routes)
- `templates/likes_playlists.html` (new virtual playlist overview page)
- `templates/likes_player.html` (new enhanced player for virtual playlists)
- `templates/playlists.html` (added navigation button)
- `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_084.md` (this documentation)

## Code Quality Compliance

# Development Log 084 - Virtual Playlists Implementation

## Summary
Implementation of virtual playlists feature based on track like counts, where tracks with the same number of likes (1 like, 2 likes, 3 likes, etc.) form separate virtual playlists with smart shuffle functionality.

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. API Development
**File:** `controllers/api/playlist_api.py`
- Created `/api/tracks_by_likes/<int:like_count>` endpoint to return tracks with exact like count
- Created `/api/like_stats` endpoint for statistics display
- Added proper URL formatting using `/media/{relpath}` instead of `/stream/{video_id}`

### 2. Route Creation
**File:** `app.py`
- Added `/likes` route for virtual playlists overview page  
- Added `/likes_player/<int:like_count>` route for specific like count player

### 3. Template Creation
**File:** `templates/likes_playlists.html`
- Main virtual playlists page with card-based interface
- Shows each like count as separate playlist with track count and samples

**File:** `templates/likes_player.html`
- Enhanced player specifically for virtual playlists
- Identical design to standard player but loads only tracks with specified like count

### 4. Specialized Player
**File:** `static/player-virtual.js`
- Copied from `player.js` with modified `fetchTracks` function
- Uses `/api/tracks_by_likes/${likeCount}` instead of standard tracks API
- Maintains all standard player functionality including smart shuffle

### 5. Navigation Integration
**File:** `templates/playlists.html`
- Added "‚ù§Ô∏è Likes Playlists" navigation button

### 6. Language Compliance
- Updated all interface text from Russian to English per project rules
- All comments, strings, and UI elements now in English only

## Issues Resolved

### Track Playback Bug (2025-06-29T21:55:17.889813+00:00)
**Problem:** Virtual playlist showed correct track count (8 tracks with 2 likes) but tracks wouldn't play, showing "NotSupportedError: The element has no supported sources" in console.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect URL formation in `tracks_by_likes` API endpoint. Was using `/stream/{video_id}` instead of `/media/{relpath}`.

**Solution:** Fixed URL formation in `controllers/api/playlist_api.py`:
```python
# Before:
"url": f"/stream/{row[0]}"

# After:  
"url": f"/media/{row[2]}"  # Use relpath, not video_id
```

**Verification:** The `/media/<path:filename>` endpoint in `app.py` serves files using `send_from_directory(ROOT_DIR, filename)`, requiring the file's relative path, not video ID.

## Features Delivered

1. **Virtual Playlist Overview:** Card-based interface showing playlists grouped by like count
2. **Dedicated Player:** Specialized player that loads only tracks with specified like count  
3. **Smart Shuffle Integration:** Existing smart shuffle algorithm works with virtual playlists
