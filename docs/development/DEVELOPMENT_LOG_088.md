## Fixed Deleted Tracks API JSON Serialization Error

### Problem
The `/deleted` page was showing "❌ Failed to load deleted tracks: Unknown error" due to:
1. **JSON Serialization Error:** API endpoint `/api/deleted_tracks` was returning 500 error with "Object of type Row is not JSON serializable"
2. **Missing Channel Groups:** JavaScript expected `channel_groups` data for filtering, but API only returned `tracks`

### Root Cause Analysis
```
User reports: ❌ Failed to load deleted tracks: Unknown error on /deleted page
    ↓
API call: GET /api/deleted_tracks returns 500 error
    ↓
Problem: SQLite Row objects cannot be directly serialized to JSON
    ↓
Secondary issue: JavaScript expects channel_groups data for filter dropdown
```

### Solution
**File:** `controllers/api/channels_api.py`

#### Fixed API Endpoint `/api/deleted_tracks`:
1. **Convert SQLite Rows to Dictionaries:**
   - Changed `db.get_deleted_tracks(conn)` result processing
   - Added conversion: `track_dict = dict(row)` for each row
   - Ensures JSON serialization compatibility

2. **Added Channel Groups Support:**
   - Extract unique channel groups from deleted tracks
   - Create channel_groups array for dropdown filter
   - Sort alphabetically for better UX

3. **Enhanced Response Structure:**
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "tracks": [...],           // Now properly serializable
     "channel_groups": [...]    // Added for filtering
   }
   ```

### Technical Implementation

#### Before (Broken):
```python
deleted_tracks = db.get_deleted_tracks(conn)
return jsonify({"status": "ok", "tracks": deleted_tracks})
# Error: SQLite Row objects not JSON serializable
```

#### After (Fixed):
```python
deleted_tracks_raw = db.get_deleted_tracks(conn)

# Convert to dictionaries
deleted_tracks = []
for row in deleted_tracks_raw:
    track_dict = dict(row)
    deleted_tracks.append(track_dict)

# Extract channel groups
channel_groups = []
unique_groups = set()
for track in deleted_tracks:
    group_name = track.get('channel_group')
    if group_name and group_name not in unique_groups:
        unique_groups.add(group_name)
        channel_groups.append({'name': group_name})

channel_groups.sort(key=lambda x: x['name'])

return jsonify({
    "status": "ok", 
    "tracks": deleted_tracks,
    "channel_groups": channel_groups
})
```

### JavaScript Integration
The fix ensures compatibility with existing JavaScript in `templates/deleted.html`:
- `loadDeletedTracks()` function now receives proper JSON data
- `populateChannelGroupFilter(data.channel_groups)` gets expected data structure
- No frontend changes required

### Benefits
1. **Fixed Error:** Eliminated 500 error and "Unknown error" message
2. **Proper JSON:** All data now JSON serializable
3. **Full Functionality:** Channel group filtering now works
4. **Better UX:** Users can filter deleted tracks by channel group
5. **Debugging:** Enhanced logging shows track and group counts

### Files Modified
- `controllers/api/channels_api.py` - Fixed JSON serialization and added channel groups

### Testing
```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl http://192.168.88.82:8000/api/deleted_tracks
# Should return: {"status": "ok", "tracks": [], "channel_groups": []}
```

### Database State
- `deleted_tracks` table exists and is properly structured
- Currently empty (0 records) which is expected behavior
- API handles empty state correctly

---
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Deleted tracks page should now load without errors
**Next:** Server restart required to apply changes, then verify page loads correctly
