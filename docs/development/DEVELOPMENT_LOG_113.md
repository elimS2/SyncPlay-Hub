# Development Log Entry #113

**Date:** 2025-07-01 13:37 UTC  
**Type:** Bug Fix - Critical System Issue  
**Scope:** Job Queue Service Singleton Initialization  

---

## üö® Issue Identified

**User Report:** Multiple parallel downloads happening simultaneously despite app.py setting `max_workers=1`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Singleton pattern in `get_job_queue_service()` was being initialized with different parameters
- If API modules called `get_job_queue_service()` before app.py, singleton created with default `max_workers=3`
- Subsequent calls from app.py with `max_workers=1` returned existing instance with 3 workers

## üîß Technical Details

**Problem:**
- Job queue service uses singleton pattern but different modules called it with inconsistent parameters
- API calls without parameters used default `max_workers=3` from function signature
- This caused 3 worker threads to process download jobs simultaneously instead of 1

**Files with Problematic Calls:**
```python
# controllers/api/jobs_api.py - 7 locations
service = get_job_queue_service()  # ‚ùå Uses default max_workers=3

# controllers/api/backup_api.py - 3 locations  
job_service = get_job_queue_service()  # ‚ùå Uses default max_workers=3

# services/auto_backup_service.py - 2 locations
self._job_queue_service = get_job_queue_service()  # ‚ùå Uses default max_workers=3
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

**Changes Made:**
- Updated all `get_job_queue_service()` calls to explicitly use `max_workers=1` parameter
- Ensures consistent single-worker behavior across entire application
- Prevents resource conflicts and bandwidth issues from parallel downloads

**Files Modified:**
1. `controllers/api/jobs_api.py` - Fixed 7 service initialization calls
2. `controllers/api/backup_api.py` - Fixed 3 service initialization calls  
3. `services/auto_backup_service.py` - Fixed 2 service initialization calls

**Fixed Calls:**
```python
# Before
service = get_job_queue_service()

# After  
service = get_job_queue_service(max_workers=1)
```

## üìä Impact Analysis

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Downloads now guaranteed to run sequentially (one at a time)  
- ‚úÖ Eliminated resource conflicts between parallel yt-dlp processes
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior regardless of module initialization order
- ‚úÖ Better system resource management and bandwidth control

**User Experience:**
- Resolves user's issue with unwanted parallel downloads
- Provides predictable, controlled download behavior
- Reduces system load and potential download failures

## üîÑ Testing & Verification

**Required Actions:**
1. **Restart server** for changes to take effect
2. **Test download queue** - verify videos download one at a time
3. **Monitor job queue status** - confirm only 1 worker active

**Expected Behavior:**
- Single download process active at any time
- No simultaneous yt-dlp instances
- Sequential job processing

## üìö Technical Context

**Singleton Pattern Issue:**
- Function signature: `get_job_queue_service(db_path=None, max_workers=3)`
- Default value `max_workers=3` caused inconsistent initialization
- First caller determines singleton configuration for entire application lifecycle

**Architecture Dependency:**
- Multiple modules depend on job queue service
- Module initialization order affects singleton behavior
- Solution ensures consistent configuration regardless of call order

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Next Steps:** Monitor system behavior after server restart
