**Numbering Issue Identified:**
During manual split, user noted indices #054-#066 were moved but actual content was #054-#063 + #067 (database import fix). This suggests some numbering confusion occurred during the manual transfer process.

**Resolution:**
- Archive 004 contains the moved entries as #054-#066
- Current file reset to start with #067 (database import fix)
- Next new entry will be #068
