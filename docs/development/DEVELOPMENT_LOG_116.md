**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 📋 Change Summary
Extended YouTube metadata support to history page and remote control interface, adding channel names, duration information, and improved track display across the entire application.

## 🔧 Files Modified
- `database.py` - Enhanced `get_history_page()` to include YouTube metadata (title, duration, channel, view count) via JOIN with `youtube_video_metadata` table
- `templates/history.html` - Added Channel and Duration columns to events table with proper formatting  
- `services/playlist_service.py` - Extended `scan_tracks()` to include comprehensive YouTube metadata in track objects
- `templates/remote.html` - Enhanced remote control to display channel names and use YouTube duration information

## 🎯 Reason for Change
User requested expansion of YouTube metadata usage to other parts of the interface beyond just the tracks page. This provides consistent YouTube metadata display across:
- History/Events page showing which channels events occurred on
- Remote control showing channel names and accurate duration
- All track listings now include rich metadata when available

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details

### 1. History Page Enhancement
Modified SQL query in `get_history_page()` to LEFT JOIN with `youtube_video_metadata` table:
```sql
SELECT ph.*, 
       COALESCE(ym.title, t.name) as name,
       ym.duration as youtube_duration,
       ym.duration_string as youtube_duration_string,
       ym.channel as youtube_channel,
       ym.view_count as youtube_view_count
FROM play_history ph 
LEFT JOIN tracks t ON t.video_id = ph.video_id
LEFT JOIN youtube_video_metadata ym ON ym.youtube_id = ph.video_id
```

### 2. Remote Control Enhancement  
Updated JavaScript to utilize YouTube metadata:
- Displays channel names in status text: `"Playing • Channel Name"`
- Uses YouTube duration for progress calculation
- Shows formatted duration strings when available (`"3:45"` vs `"225 seconds"`)
- Maintains fallback to filename-based display

### 3. Comprehensive Track Data
Enhanced `scan_tracks()` to provide rich metadata objects:
```python
track_data.update({
    "youtube_title": metadata.get('title'),
    "youtube_channel": metadata.get('channel'),
    "youtube_duration": metadata.get('duration'),
    "youtube_duration_string": metadata.get('duration_string'),
    "youtube_view_count": metadata.get('view_count'),
    "youtube_uploader": metadata.get('uploader'),
})
```

## 🎁 User Benefits
- **Consistent Experience**: YouTube metadata displayed consistently across entire app
- **Rich Information**: Channel names, view counts, and accurate durations visible
- **Better Organization**: History page shows channel context for all events  
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, informative display of track information

## 📊 Impact Analysis
- **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Full fallback support for tracks without metadata
- **Performance**: ✅ Efficient LEFT JOIN queries with minimal overhead
- **User Experience**: ✅ Significantly improved information density and clarity
- **Database Load**: ✅ Leverages existing metadata without additional API calls

## 🔄 Before/After Comparison

### History Page
**Before:** Basic event list with filename-based track names  
**After:** Rich event table with Channel and Duration columns, clean YouTube titles

### Remote Control  
**Before:** `"Playing"` status with filename in title  
**After:** `"Playing • MamaRika"` status with clean YouTube title and accurate duration

### Track Data Objects
**Before:** Basic file info with filename-based names  
**After:** Comprehensive metadata objects with YouTube channel, duration, view counts
