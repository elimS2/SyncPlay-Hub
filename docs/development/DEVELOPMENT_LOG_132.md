# Development Log Entry #132

### Log Entry #132 - 2025-07-05 18:11 UTC

**Type:** Critical Bug Fix  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Completed  

**What Changed:**
- Fixed critical Windows file deletion error (WinError 32) when deleting tracks during playback
- Updated `deleteTrack` function in `static/player.js` to properly release file locks
- Enhanced API delete endpoint with retry mechanism and improved error handling
- Added comprehensive file lock detection and retry logic for Windows compatibility

**Why Changed:**
- Users experiencing "Failed to move file to trash: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process" 
- File locks preventing track deletion when audio/video files are currently being played
- Inconsistent behavior between "Delete Current" button (working) and track list deletion (failing)

**Technical Details:**

**Client-Side Fix (`static/player.js`):**
- Added file lock release logic to `deleteTrack` function for consistency with `deleteCurrentBtn` handler
- Implemented media player cleanup before deletion:
  ```javascript
  // CRITICAL: If this is the currently playing track, pause and release file lock
  if (trackIndex === currentIndex && !media.paused) {
    media.pause();
    currentTime = media.currentTime; // Save position for potential restore
    media.src = ''; // This releases the file lock
    media.load(); // Ensure the media element is properly reset
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200)); // Wait for full release
  }
  ```
- Added playback restoration on deletion failure
- Enhanced error messages and user notifications

**Server-Side Enhancement (`controllers/api/channels_api.py`):**
- Implemented robust retry mechanism for Windows file operations
- Added `move_file_with_retry` function with:
  - Up to 3 retry attempts with 0.5s delays
  - File lock detection using exclusive file access test
  - Specific Windows error handling (WinError 32, "being used by another process")
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added initial 0.3s delay to allow client-side file release
- Improved error messages for better user experience

**Impact Analysis:**
- **User Experience:** Significantly reduced file deletion failures
- **System Reliability:** Robust error handling prevents operation failures
- **Cross-Platform:** Enhanced Windows compatibility while maintaining cross-platform functionality
- **Performance:** Minimal impact with short delays and limited retry attempts

**Files Modified:**
- `static/player.js` - Updated `deleteTrack` function with file lock release logic
- `controllers/api/channels_api.py` - Enhanced API delete endpoint with retry mechanism

**Error Handling Improvements:**
- Client detects currently playing tracks and releases media file locks
- Server implements exponential backoff and file lock detection
- User-friendly error messages indicate when to retry operations
- Automatic playback restoration if deletion fails

**Testing Results:**
- Fixed deletion of currently playing tracks from track list
- Maintained existing functionality for "Delete Current" button
- Improved success rate for file operations on Windows systems
- Enhanced debugging capability with detailed logging

**Related Issues:**
- Windows file lock errors during track deletion resolved
- Consistency between different deletion methods achieved
- Improved system reliability for media file operations
- Better user experience with informative error messages

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor deletion success rates in production
- Consider additional file handling improvements if needed
- Document best practices for media file operations
