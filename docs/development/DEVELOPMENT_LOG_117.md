**Type:** Bug Fix / Hotfix  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 📋 Change Summary
Quick fix for scan_tracks() function - resolved sqlite3.Row access issue that was preventing track list display.

## 🔧 Files Modified
- `services/playlist_service.py` - Fixed sqlite3.Row object access in YouTube metadata handling

## 🐛 Problem Identified
After implementing YouTube metadata enhancement in Entry #116, the track list became empty due to improper handling of `sqlite3.Row` objects. The code was trying to access Row object as a dictionary, causing silent failures.

## ⚙️ Technical Fix

### Issue
```python
# ❌ This was failing silently:
if youtube_metadata and youtube_metadata['title']:
    display_name = youtube_metadata['title']
```

### Solution
```python
# ✅ Proper sqlite3.Row access:
if metadata_row:
    title = metadata_row['title'] if 'title' in metadata_row.keys() else None
    if title:
        display_name = title
        youtube_metadata = metadata_row
```

### Improvements Made
1. **Proper Row Access**: Check column existence before accessing via `'title' in metadata_row.keys()`
2. **Safe Field Extraction**: Individual field checks for each metadata property
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added debug prints to catch similar issues in future
4. **Defensive Programming**: Graceful fallback when metadata access fails

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis
- **sqlite3.Row vs Dict**: `sqlite3.Row` objects behave like dictionaries but have different internal mechanics
- **Silent Failures**: Exceptions in metadata access were caught but caused empty track lists
- **Testing Gap**: Need better error visibility during development

## 📊 Impact Analysis
- **Functionality**: ✅ Track lists now display correctly with YouTube metadata
- **Performance**: ✅ No performance impact, only improved error handling  
- **User Experience**: ✅ Application fully functional again
- **Stability**: ✅ More robust error handling for future metadata operations

## 🔄 Before/After

### Before (Broken)
- Empty track lists on all playlist pages
- No error messages visible to user
- Silent failure in metadata processing

### After (Fixed)  
- Full track lists with YouTube metadata integration
- Proper fallback to filename when metadata unavailable
- Debug output for troubleshooting future issues

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures
1. **Type Safety**: Consider using typed data classes for metadata
2. **Testing**: Add unit tests for sqlite3.Row object handling
3. **Error Visibility**: Improve error logging and debugging tools
4. **Documentation**: Document sqlite3.Row vs dict differences

## ✅ Resolution
Quick hotfix resolved the critical issue and restored full functionality with enhanced YouTube metadata support. Users can now enjoy rich track information across the entire application without any display problems.

**Recovery Time**: ~8 minutes from issue identification to resolution
