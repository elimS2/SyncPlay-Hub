## Major Breakthrough - Entry #053

**BREAKTHROUGH**: WELLBOYmusic channel download working! Root cause identified and resolved.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- yt-dlp returns only 2 playlist entries instead of individual videos:
  - Entry #1: 'Wellboy - Videos' (contains 37 videos)
  - Entry #2: 'Wellboy - Shorts' (contains 80 videos)
- System was selecting last entry ('Wellboy - Shorts') and downloading from it
- download_archive was disabled successfully - no more skipping

**Current Status - SUCCESS**:
- ✅ **Files are downloading**: 12+ files downloaded and continuing
- ✅ **Target folder**: `D:\music\Youtube\Playlists\New Music\Channel-Wellboy_-_Shorts`
- ✅ **Downloaded tracks**: "В Душевном Криму", "Ґуля", "Себе немає", "Чорний автомат", "Прийшов"
- ✅ **Progress tracking**: Working correctly (counter bug but downloads work)

## Archive Notes

**File Size Issue**: DEVELOPMENT_LOG_CURRENT.md became too large (3623+ lines, 148KB) causing:
- Edit restrictions in development tools
- Performance issues with file operations  
- Difficulty navigating and finding specific entries
- Duplicate entry numbers due to file management complexity

**Solution**: Created this archive to preserve entries #020-#053, will reset CURRENT file for new entries starting #054.

**Entry Numbering Issue**: Due to file size and merge conflicts, some entries have duplicate numbers. This archive preserves the historical record while allowing clean numbering going forward.
