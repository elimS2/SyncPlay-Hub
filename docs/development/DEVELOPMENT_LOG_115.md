# Development Log Entry #115

**Date:** 2025-07-02 22:41 UTC  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 📋 Change Summary
Enhanced track name display logic to use YouTube metadata titles when available, with fallback to filename for tracks without metadata.

## 🔧 Files Modified
- `database.py` - Updated `iter_tracks_with_playlists()` function to JOIN with `youtube_video_metadata` table and use `COALESCE(ym.title, t.name)` for display names
- `templates/tracks.html` - Changed track name display to use new `display_name` field instead of `name`
- `services/playlist_service.py` - Modified `scan_tracks()` function to fetch YouTube metadata and use title as display name
- `controllers/api/playlist_api.py` - Updated `api_tracks_by_likes()` to use YouTube metadata titles in virtual playlists

## 🎯 Reason for Change
User requested that track names should display YouTube video titles from metadata when available, instead of always showing filenames. This provides cleaner, more readable track names in playlists (e.g., "Drake - God's Plan" instead of "Drake - God's Plan [kbMqWXnpXcM]").

## 📊 What Changed

### 1. Database Query Enhancement
**File:** `database.py`
- Added LEFT JOIN with `youtube_video_metadata` table in `iter_tracks_with_playlists()`
- Used `COALESCE(ym.title, t.name)` to prefer metadata title over filename
- Added `display_name` field to query results
- Updated ORDER BY clause to sort by enhanced display names

```sql
SELECT t.*, 
       GROUP_CONCAT(p.name, ', ') AS playlists,
       COALESCE(ym.title, t.name) AS display_name
FROM tracks t
LEFT JOIN track_playlists tp ON tp.track_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN playlists p ON p.id = tp.playlist_id
LEFT JOIN youtube_video_metadata ym ON ym.youtube_id = t.video_id
GROUP BY t.id
ORDER BY COALESCE(ym.title, t.name) COLLATE NOCASE
```

### 2. Dynamic Track Scanning
**File:** `services/playlist_service.py`
- Modified `scan_tracks()` to lookup YouTube metadata for each track
- Returns metadata title as track name when available
- Gracefully falls back to filename if metadata lookup fails
- Added proper database connection management

### 3. Virtual Playlists Support
**File:** `controllers/api/playlist_api.py`
- Updated likes-based virtual playlists to use YouTube metadata titles
- Maintained consistent naming across all playlist types
- Enhanced SQL query with COALESCE logic

### 4. Template Updates
**File:** `templates/tracks.html`
- Changed track display template to use `display_name` field
- Preserves existing functionality while showing cleaner titles

## 🎯 Impact Analysis

### ✅ Positive Impacts
- **User Experience:** Track names now display as clean YouTube titles instead of filenames with video IDs
- **Backward Compatibility:** Tracks without metadata still display filename as before
- **Performance:** Minimal impact - metadata lookups use existing indexed database queries
- **Consistency:** All playlist pages (regular, virtual, tracks page) now use same display logic

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Database Dependency:** Requires YouTube metadata to be present in database for enhanced display
- **Additional Query:** Each track scan now includes a metadata lookup (minimal performance impact)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Used SQL COALESCE function for efficient fallback logic
- Added proper database connection management in playlist service
- Maintained existing API contract while enhancing returned data
- No breaking changes to existing endpoints or data structures

## 🧪 Testing Results
- **Tracks Page (`/tracks`):** ✅ Displays clean names from metadata when available
- **Playlist Pages:** ✅ Shows enhanced titles in track lists
- **Virtual Playlists:** ✅ Likes-based playlists use metadata titles
- **Fallback Logic:** ✅ Files without metadata show original filenames

## 📈 User Experience Enhancement
**Before:** `"Drake - God's Plan [kbMqWXnpXcM]"`  
**After:** `"Drake - God's Plan"`

This change significantly improves readability while maintaining full backward compatibility for tracks without metadata.
