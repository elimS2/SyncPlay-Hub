### Log Entry #001 - 2025-06-28 23:29 UTC

**Affected Files:**
- `scripts/channel_download_analyzer.py` - ✅ Enhanced with incomplete download detection

**What Changed:**
Successfully implemented and tested automatic detection and fixing of incomplete downloads (.f251 audio-only files).

**Functionality Added:**
1. **Incomplete Download Detection**: 
   - New function `detect_incomplete_downloads()` identifies videos with only .f251 audio files
   - Scans channel folders to find missing video components
   - Uses regex patterns to match video IDs across file formats

2. **Automatic Job Queue Integration**:
   - New function `queue_incomplete_download_fixes()` creates single video download jobs
   - Uses `JobType.SINGLE_VIDEO_DOWNLOAD` with format `bestvideo+bestaudio/best`
   - Automatically determines target folder structure from existing path

3. **Enhanced Analysis Output**:
   - Shows incomplete download count in channel summaries
   - Lists first 5 incomplete downloads with file sizes
   - Provides clear visual indicators (⚠️ vs ✅)

4. **New Command Line Option**:
   - Added `--auto-queue-incomplete` flag
   - Updated help text with usage examples
   - Integrated with existing channel analysis workflow

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Successfully tested on channel halsey (ID 15)
- ✅ Detected 99 incomplete downloads (.f251 audio-only files)
- ✅ Created 99 jobs (ID 25-123) in job queue automatically
- ✅ Jobs configured with proper format selectors and target folders
- ✅ Integration with existing job queue system works seamlessly

**Usage Example:**
```bash
python scripts/channel_download_analyzer.py --channel-id 15 --auto-queue-incomplete
```

**Impact:**
Solves the problem reported by user about .f251 files (audio-only) missing video components. Now the system can automatically detect such incomplete downloads and queue jobs to re-download them with proper video quality. This ensures all tracks have both audio and video components as intended.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor job queue execution to verify downloads complete successfully
  - Consider expanding to analyze all channels for incomplete downloads
  - Potentially integrate this check into regular channel sync operations

## Conclusion
Functionality successfully implemented and tested. The system can now automatically detect incomplete downloads and queue repair jobs through the existing Job Queue system.
