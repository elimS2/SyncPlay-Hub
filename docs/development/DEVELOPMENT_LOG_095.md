# Development Log Entry #095

### Log Entry #095 - 2025-06-30 16:34 UTC

**TYPE:** UI/UX Improvement  
**COMPONENT:** Job Queue Management Interface  
**FILES MODIFIED:** templates/jobs.html  
**DEVELOPER:** AI Assistant  

## Summary
Removed confirmation dialog for "Retry" button in job queue management interface per user request to improve workflow efficiency.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **templates/jobs.html**
   - **Line 998**: Removed `if (!confirm(\`Are you sure you want to retry job #${jobId}?\`)) return;` from `retryJob()` function
   - **Effect**: Retry button now executes immediately without confirmation dialog

## Technical Details

### Before:
```javascript
async function retryJob(jobId) {
    if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to retry job #${jobId}?`)) return;
    
    try {
        // ... retry logic
    }
}
```

### After:
```javascript
async function retryJob(jobId) {
    try {
        // ... retry logic
    }
}
```

## Rationale
- User feedback indicated confirmation dialog was unnecessary for retry operations
- Retry operations are generally safe and reversible
- Improved user workflow efficiency by removing extra click
- Cancel operations still retain confirmation dialog for safety

## Impact Analysis
- **User Experience**: ✅ Improved - faster job retry workflow
- **Safety**: ✅ Acceptable - retry operations are non-destructive
- **Consistency**: ✅ Maintained - cancel operations still have confirmation
- **Performance**: ✅ Neutral - no performance impact

## Testing Notes
- Change affects client-side JavaScript only
- No server-side modifications required
- No database schema changes
- Immediate effect upon page reload

## User Request Context
User reported on page http://192.168.88.82:8000/jobs that clicking "Retry" showed unnecessary confirmation popup "Are you sure you want to retry job #542?" and requested its removal for improved workflow.
