**Type:** Enhancement  
**Status:** Completed  

## Enhancement: Automatic Folder Cleanup After Track Downloads

### Files Modified
- `services/job_workers/playlist_download_worker.py`

### Changes Made

1. **Added comprehensive temp file cleanup method**:
   - `_cleanup_folder_temp_files()` method for automatic cleanup
   - Removes all temporary files in download folder, not just specific track files
   - Handles patterns: `*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `*.part`, `*.download`, `*.ytdl`, `*.pyc`
   - Removes YouTube metadata files: `*.info.json`, `*.description`, `*.thumbnail`, `*.webp`, `*.jpg`, `*.png`
   - Removes `__pycache__` directories
   - Provides detailed logging of cleanup results

2. **Integrated cleanup into download workflow**:
   - Single video downloads: cleanup after successful download + database scan
   - Playlist downloads: cleanup after successful download + database scan
   - Only triggers on successful downloads to avoid interfering with failed attempts

3. **Enhanced folder management**:
   - Cleanup targets the specific download folder, not entire system
   - Calculates and reports freed disk space
   - Graceful error handling for locked/protected files

### Implementation Logic
```
Download Track → Update Database → Clean Folder → Complete
```

### Benefits
- Automatic cleanup of all temporary files in download folder
- No manual intervention needed
- Prevents accumulation of metadata files over time
- Frees disk space immediately after downloads
- More efficient than file-specific cleanup

### Technical Details
- Cleanup method is robust with exception handling
- Uses pathlib glob patterns for efficient file matching
- Provides detailed logging for transparency
- Works for both single videos and playlist downloads

### Impact Analysis
- ✅ Reduces disk space usage from temporary files
- ✅ Prevents folder clutter from accumulated metadata
- ✅ Maintains clean directory structure
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Better user experience with automated maintenance

### Summary
This enhancement provides the requested automatic cleanup functionality where after downloading any track, the system cleans up all temporary files in the target folder rather than just files related to the specific track.

- Test with single video downloads
- Test with playlist downloads
- Verify cleanup only happens after successful downloads
- Check that locked files don't break the process
