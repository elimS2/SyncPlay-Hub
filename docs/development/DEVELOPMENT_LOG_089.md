# Development Log Entry #089

**Date:** 2025-06-29 23:42 UTC  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Priority:** Medium  

---

## 📋 Summary

Added missing "Removed" event type filter to Events page and performed database analysis to explain count discrepancies between `/deleted` and `/events?event_types=removed` pages.

---

## 🎯 Issue Reported by User

- Missing filter option for "removed" event type on `/events` page  
- Discrepancy in counts: 49 tracks on `/deleted` vs 124 events on `/events?event_types=removed`

---

## ⚡ Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Removed Filter to Events Page

**File**: `templates/history.html`

```html
<!-- Added to templates/history.html -->
<label class="event-type-checkbox" for="filter-removed">
  <input type="checkbox" id="filter-removed" {% if not filters.event_types_filter_applied or (filters.event_types and 'removed' in filters.event_types) %}checked{% endif %}>
  <span>Removed</span>
</label>
```

### 2. Added Removed Event Type to Reference Guide

```html
<div><span class="event-removed">🔴 removed</span> - Track deleted from library/playlist</div>
```

---

## 🔍 Database Analysis Performed

- Investigated structure: `tracks.db` contains `deleted_tracks` table and `play_history` events
- Found event type "removed" is supported in code (`database.py:359`)
- Used in deletion workflows (`download_content.py`, `controllers/api/channels_api.py`)

### Key Findings

#### Different Data Sources:
- **Page `/deleted`**: Shows records from `deleted_tracks` table (physical deletions)
- **Page `/events?event_types=removed`**: Shows "removed" events from `play_history` (event log)

#### Legitimate Reasons for Count Differences:
1. **Multiple Deletions**: Same track deleted/restored/deleted again = multiple events, one deleted_tracks record
2. **Historical Events**: `play_history` keeps all events, `deleted_tracks` only current state
3. **Time Filtering**: `/deleted` page filters by last 30 days (default), `/events` shows all history
4. **Restored Tracks**: Events remain in history even after tracks are restored from trash

---

## ✅ User Experience Improvements

- **Complete Filter Set**: All event types now available for filtering
- **Visual Consistency**: Removed events styled with red color (🔴)
- **Proper Documentation**: Added to event types reference guide
- **Functional Parity**: Events page now covers all logged event types

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **CSS Styling**: `.event-removed{color:#f44336;}` - red color for removed events
- **Template Logic**: Standard checkbox pattern with filter state preservation
- **JavaScript Integration**: Automatic inclusion in existing filter system
- **State Management**: Works with existing URL-based filtering and Toggle All functionality

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Users can now filter and analyze track deletion patterns
- **Better Debugging**: Full access to deletion events helps identify sync issues
- **Data Completeness**: Events page now shows complete picture of all logged activities
- **User Understanding**: Clear explanation of count differences reduces confusion

---

## 📁 Files Modified

- `templates/history.html` - Added removed filter checkbox and reference entry

---

## 🧹 Cleanup Required

- Created temporary analysis scripts: `analyze_removed_difference.py`, `check_db_path.py`
- These should be removed after issue resolution

---

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] Filter checkbox appears on Events page
- [x] Filter functionality works correctly
- [x] Visual styling matches other event types
- [x] Reference guide updated
- [x] URL-based filtering preserved

---

## 📝 Notes

This enhancement completes the event filtering system by adding the previously missing "removed" event type. The database analysis revealed that count discrepancies between different pages are expected behavior due to different data sources and filtering logic.
