# Development Log Entry #130

**Date:** 2025-07-05 11:51 UTC  
**Type:** Bug Fix - Critical  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Completed  

## What Changed

Fixed critical issue where `trash_bp` blueprint was registered without URL prefix, causing 404 errors on `/deleted` page. JavaScript code expects `/api/trash_stats` but routes were available as `/trash_stats`.

**Changes made:**
- Added `url_prefix='/api'` to `trash_bp` registration in `app.py`
- Routes now properly accessible as `/api/trash_stats`, `/api/clear_trash`, etc.
- Resolves "Unexpected token '<'" JSON parsing error on deleted page
- Maintains consistency with other API endpoints

## Why Changed

After completing trash API refactoring in entry #128, the `/deleted` page was showing network errors:
- Error: `❌ Network error: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`
- This indicated JavaScript was receiving HTML (404 error page) instead of expected JSON
- Root cause: Blueprint routes were registered without `/api` prefix

## Technical Details

**Problem:**
```python
# Before (incorrect)
app.register_blueprint(trash_bp)  # Routes: /trash_stats, /clear_trash
```

**Solution:**
```python
# After (correct)
app.register_blueprint(trash_bp, url_prefix='/api')  # Routes: /api/trash_stats, /api/clear_trash
```

**JavaScript expectations:**
```javascript
// JavaScript code expects these URLs:
const response = await fetch('/api/trash_stats');
const response = await fetch('/api/clear_trash', { method: 'POST' });
```

## Impact Analysis

- **Frontend:** All trash management features now work correctly on `/deleted` page
- **API Consistency:** All API endpoints now have uniform `/api/` prefix
- **Error Resolution:** Eliminates JSON parsing errors and 404 network errors
- **User Experience:** Trash statistics display and clear functionality fully operational

## Files Modified

- `app.py` - Line 506: Added `url_prefix='/api'` to trash_bp registration

## Testing Status

- ✅ `/deleted` page loads without errors
- ✅ Trash statistics display correctly
- ✅ Clear trash functionality works properly
- ✅ All trash API endpoints accessible at correct URLs
- ✅ Consistent with other API blueprint registrations

## Related Issues

- Fixes issues introduced during trash API refactoring (entry #128)
- Ensures trash management system works end-to-end
- Maintains architectural consistency with existing API structure

## Next Steps

- System fully operational
- All trash management features working correctly
- Ready for production use
