# Timestamp Correction Summary Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive timestamp correction across all development log files, synchronizing documentation with actual git commit times. This critical fix restored accurate traceability between code changes and their documentation.

## Issue Resolved

### Problem
- **Timeline Discrepancy:** Development log entries showed placeholder dates (2025-01-21)
- **Actual Git Dates:** Real commits were from 2025-06-19 to 2025-06-21
- **Impact:** 6-month discrepancy broke connection between documentation and code changes

### Root Cause
Development log entries were created with placeholder timestamps instead of actual commit times, violating fundamental documentation traceability principles.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
- Retrieved complete git log with timestamps and commit hashes
- Mapped all 20 log entries to their corresponding git commits
- Created detailed correction plan with verification procedures

### 2. Systematic Corrections
**Files Updated:**
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_001.md` - Entries #001-#010 (10 entries)
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_002.md` - Entries #011-#019 + #014A (10 entries)
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_CURRENT.md` - Entry #020 + new Entry #021
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG_INDEX.md` - All date references and navigation
- `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` - Recent commits section

### 3. Enhanced Format
**New Entry Header Format:**
```markdown
### Log Entry #XXX - 2025-06-21 04:22:33 +0300 (Git: d103aa6)
**Change:** Brief description
**Commit:** `d103aa6` - Commit subject line
```
