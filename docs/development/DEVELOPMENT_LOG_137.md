**Type:** UI/UX Enhancement - Video Player Responsive Design  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Completed  

**What Changed:**
- Added responsive sizing styles for video player in both likes_player.html and index.html
- Implemented max-height constraint to prevent vertical videos from exceeding viewport
- Added object-fit: contain to maintain aspect ratio
- Added black background for better video presentation
- Applied consistent styling across both virtual playlists and regular playlists

**Why Changed:**
- Vertical videos (portrait orientation) were overflowing below the visible screen area
- Users were unable to see video controls and content when viewing vertical videos
- Need better responsive design for mixed video orientations (landscape/portrait)

**Technical Details:**
- Added new CSS rule for `#player` element:
  ```css
  #player {
    width: 100%;
    max-height: calc(100vh - 200px); /* Prevent vertical videos from exceeding viewport */
    object-fit: contain; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
    background: #000;
  }
  ```
- `max-height: calc(100vh - 200px)` reserves space for controls and header
- `object-fit: contain` ensures video maintains proportions while fitting container
- `background: #000` provides clean black background for video letterboxing

**Impact Analysis:**
- **User Experience:** Vertical videos now properly fit within screen boundaries
- **Accessibility:** Video controls remain visible and accessible
- **Compatibility:** Works across all modern browsers
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved for all video formats

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/likes_player.html` - Added responsive video styling
- `templates/index.html` - Added responsive video styling for playlist pages

**Testing:**
- Vertical videos now properly constrained to screen height
- Horizontal videos maintain existing behavior
- Video controls remain accessible at bottom of screen
- Fullscreen mode unaffected by changes

**Before/After:**
- **Before:** Vertical videos could extend beyond screen height, hiding controls
- **After:** All videos properly sized within viewport boundaries with visible controls

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support  
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile browsers: Full support

**Related Issues:**
- Resolves viewport overflow issues for portrait-oriented videos on both virtual playlists (/likes_player/) and regular playlists (/playlist/)
- Improves overall video player user experience across all playlist types
- Maintains consistent interface regardless of video orientation
- Provides unified responsive behavior for all video playback pages
