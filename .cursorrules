# Cursor IDE Project Rules

## ðŸš¨ DEVELOPMENT LOG DISCONTINUED - 2025-07-06 ðŸš¨
**Development log maintenance has been discontinued to reduce overhead and token consumption.**

**NEW POLICY: Use detailed commit messages instead of development logs**

**Prompt for comprehensive commit messages:**
```
"Give an exhaustive, detailed comment for the commit, I will copy-paste it and make the commit"
```

**For development history, use git commands:**
- `git log --oneline -10` - Recent commits
- `git log --stat -5` - Commits with file changes
- `git log -p -3` - Full diff history
- `git log --grep="keyword"` - Search commits

## Code Language Policy (MANDATORY)
- ALL source code MUST be written exclusively in ENGLISH
- This includes: variables, functions, classes, comments, documentation, strings, commit messages, error messages, logging, API responses
- NO exceptions - even if developer communicates in another language

## Communication Language Policy
- Assistant responses should match the developer's query language
- Code language remains English regardless of communication language

## Enforcement
- Never inject non-English languages into code
- Translate existing non-English code to English when modifying
- All new code follows English-only conventions

## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, style, chore
- Include comprehensive details in commit body
- Explain what, why, technical details, and impact
- Example:
  ```
  feat: implement comprehensive trash management system
  
  - Add trash statistics API endpoint (/api/trash_stats)
  - Implement clear trash functionality with confirmation
  - Add UI section with modern card layout
  - Preserve database records while removing physical files
  
  Technical details:
  - Uses shutil.rmtree() for efficient directory cleanup
  - Implements graceful error handling for file operations
  - Maintains data integrity by preserving audit trail
  
  Impact: Provides disk space management while maintaining data safety
  Files: controllers/api/channels_api.py, templates/deleted.html
  ```

## Git Commands (RECOMMENDED)
- **RECOMMENDED: Use --no-pager flag with git commands** (prevents hanging in PowerShell)
- **Better:** `git --no-pager log --oneline -10`
- **May hang:** `git log --oneline -10` (in PowerShell)
- **Useful for:** log, rev-list, show, and all output commands
- **Benefits:** Cross-platform compatibility and script-friendly output

## Priority
- These rules override any other language preferences
- Code quality and international standards take precedence
- Detailed commit messages are encouraged for better development tracking
